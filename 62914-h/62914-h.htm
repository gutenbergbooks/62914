<div style='font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.7em;'>AUTHOR’S INTRODUCTION</div>
</div>

<p>Among all the various arms of government in our nation, no arm is at
once less known or more worthy of renown than the Coast Guard. Like the
knights of the Table Round, this company of gallant surfmen and sailors
is organized and exists almost solely for the protection of others.
Though few in numbers, the Coast Guard accomplishes deeds that are
mighty. Skill of the highest order, daring incredible, and discipline
that is perfect, make a giant of this little service. Stout of heart,
indeed, must be the men who belong to it; for when others are fleeing
for their lives, the Coast Guard is always heading straight for the
danger, to rescue those incompetent or unable to effect their own
rescue. Let those who think the age of romance is past but read the
story of the Coast Guard and they will change their minds.</p>

<p>For those who demand that fiction be based upon actual occurrence, the
author wishes to say that this book is hardly more than a transcript
from life. Every major incident in it is based upon an actual happening.
It was the Coast Guard cutter <i>Yamacraw</i> that lost six boatloads of
seamen in the surf while attempting to rescue a helpless steamer. It was
the <i>Seneca</i> that searched the wintry seas for the helpless oil tanker
that had been abandoned by the tug towing it. And the final incident in
the book, in which a stricken freighter sinks in a storm, and the
wireless operator ministers calmly to his commander in the face of
almost certain death, is but a poor attempt to recite the story of
“Smiling Jimmy Nevins,” a mere lad, who went smiling to his death as a
member of a volunteer crew from the <i>Seneca</i>, in an effort to save a
torpedoed freighter for the Allies during the recent World War.</p>

<p>In preparation for the writing of this story, the author spent some time
aboard both the <i>Seneca</i> and the <i>Tampa</i>. He wishes here to express his
admiration for the Coast Guard as a whole, and his very great
indebtedness to Captain B. H. Camden, of the <i>Seneca</i>, Captain Wm. J.
Wheeler, of the <i>Tampa</i>, Lieutenant C. C. Von Paulson, of the <i>Tampa</i>,
and Chief Electrician Belton Miller, of the <i>Seneca</i>, for their kindly
assistance. Each of the four has played a heroic part in some of the
deeds portrayed in this book.</p>

</div>

<p>Reading into the present the history of the early mariner along our
shores, one is impressed with the march of civilization. Institutions
having for their purpose the saving of human life are products of
civilization—a part of the great scheme of humanization.</p>

<p>This volume, dedicated “To those unsung heroes, the men of the U. S.
Coast Guard,” is an interesting, an engaging, and a compelling portrayal
of the everyday work of the Coast Guard, with its vicissitudes,
hardships, perils and accomplishments. The Coast Guard in fact is an
establishment of service and opportunity—service to those whose fortunes
are cast with the deep and along our shores, opportunity for the young
men of the nation of character, stability and fixedness of purpose, to
follow the Stars and Stripes in the ever-beautiful cause of humanity.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER I</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>HENRY SEEKS HIS FORTUNE</span>
</h2>

<p>Henry Harper was making his way down the longest street in the world as
fast as the jam of traffic would allow. But this longest street in the
world, Broadway in New York City, is also one of the world’s busiest
thoroughfares, and, despite his haste, Henry Harper could proceed but
slowly. It was the noon hour, and the sidewalks were jammed with
thousands upon thousands of clerks, stenographers, business men, and
other busy workers, going to or from their luncheons. The streets were
overflowing with vehicular traffic, as the sidewalks were with
foot-passengers. No matter to which side Henry darted, there was always
some person or some vehicle in front of him, and so, though quivering
with impatience, he was obliged to curb his speed and make his way the
best he could among pedestrians and trucks. He was bound for the office
of the United States Secret Service, and it seemed to him that he would
never get there. He had just come to New York from his home in Central
City, Pennsylvania, and he was on his way to see his old friend Willie
Brown, who had some time previously won a position with the Secret
Service.</p>

<p>When, finally, he did reach his destination, Henry found himself facing
a situation that troubled him a great deal more than he cared to admit.
Willie Brown was not in the office. What was more, Willie was not even
in town. He had been sent away on some special duty. The office boy did
not know when Willie would return. All he knew was that Willie had
started on a trip that would probably last two or three weeks, and there
was no one in the office who could give Henry any more definite
information. All the clerks were out at luncheon, but they probably
wouldn’t know where Willie was going, anyway. And the Chief, who had
given Willie his orders in person, had left for the day.</p>

<p>If Henry had wanted to see Willie merely to renew old acquaintanceship,
the situation would have been unpleasant enough. But it was a thousand
times worse than that, for Henry had come to New York upon Willie’s
express invitation, and the latter was going to try to help him get a
job. Henry had not told him exactly when he would arrive, and so he
could not blame him for not being on hand or for not leaving a message
for him. Willie’s absence made it mighty unpleasant for Henry, though,
for the latter had expected to be his guest, and his funds were slender.
Indeed, he had little more than enough money to pay his return car fare.
Two or three days at a New York hotel would exhaust these funds
entirely. No wonder Henry looked worried as he slowly left the building
and stepped once more into the seething jam on Broadway.</p>

<p>“I’ll slip over to the Confederated Steamship Office,” thought Henry to
himself. “I know the <i>Lycoming</i> is at sea, and Roy won’t be back in New
York for almost a week. But maybe I can find some one who can help me
out of my difficulty.” So he headed hopefully toward the piers on the
Hudson River front, occupied by the coastwise steamship line for which
another of his old chums, Roy Mercer, now worked as a wireless operator
on the steamer <i>Lycoming</i>.</p>

<p>Again he was doomed to disappointment. Not a ship lay in the docks. Not
an official of any sort could be found about the place. Only a watchman
was in charge, at the gate, and he proved to be gruff and surly. If only
one of the <i>Lycoming’s</i> sister ships had been in port, Henry would have
appealed to the wireless operator on her, and trusted to the freemasonry
that exists among wireless men generally. But there was no such luck for
him. Apparently there was no one he could reach to whom he could appeal.
Here he was, stranded in the metropolis, without a friend or an
acquaintance, with no job in sight, and with only a very few dollars in
his pocket. It was a situation to take the heart out of almost any boy.</p>

<p>But Henry was no ordinary boy. To begin with, he was approaching
manhood. In a year or two he would be old enough to vote. He was as
large as most men, and as independent mentally as he was sturdy
physically, so he did not become alarmed and panic-stricken, as a
younger lad might have, but set himself to think out the best course he
could pursue. He knew that all he had to do was to find some way to tide
himself over until either Roy or Willie returned, and things would be
all right.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was worried about his money. For even though he could
readily borrow from his friends upon their return, it wouldn’t be
exactly an easy thing to repay the loan. The money in his pocket was
about all the money he had in the world.</p>

<p>With Roy and Willie, he had belonged to the Camp Brady Wireless Patrol.
Indeed, it was Henry himself who had organized that little group of
boys, and who had made the first wireless set they possessed, by the use
of some patterns given him by an uncle. And he had become probably the
most expert wireless operator in the patrol. In fact, during an
emergency he had served for a time as a government operator in the big
wireless station at Frankfort, not so many miles from his home in
Central City.</p>

<p>When he thought of those days Henry sighed, almost with bitterness. Then
he was the leader in every respect. Not only was he the oldest boy in
the Wireless Patrol, but he was farthest advanced. In the nature of
things he should by this time have been far along the road to success,
and in a position to help his friends; whereas it had actually turned
out that he was behind them all, and that they were helping him instead.
Yet it was no fault of Henry’s. His father’s death had thrown upon him
the burden of supporting not only himself but his mother as well. Henry
had given up his work at the high school for a time, but his mother had
insisted upon his completing it. It had taken him twice as long to
finish his course this way as it would have, could he have gone on
without interruption. But now he was glad he had listened to his mother.
Even though he was so late getting started, he knew he would go farther
in the end.</p>

<p>But was he started? The question worried Henry so much that he could
hardly think. He had come to New York with high hopes of getting a real
start, and now he seemed about to waste the few remaining dollars he
possessed. What should he do? The roar of the traffic disturbed him. He
could not think connectedly. He wanted to compose himself, so he made
his way down the water-front to Battery Park, where he might be
undisturbed while he thought out his problem.</p>

<p>But the familiar scenes in Battery Park set a new train of thought in
motion in his head, and utterly defeated, for the time, his plan to
think out his course of action, for in front of him, as he sat on a park
bench, was the old, familiar harbor, with its seething waters and its
throbbing life. And straight across the rolling waves was Staten Island,
where he had spent those memorable days in that never-to-be-forgotten
hunt for the secret wireless of the Germans, during the war, when the
Secret Service had accepted the proffered help of the Wireless Patrol in
the search for the treacherous spies that were betraying the movements
of American transports. How clearly all the incidents of that search for
the secret wireless now stood out in Henry’s mind. He could recall, as
though it had been but yesterday, the departure of the selected unit of
the patrol—Roy Mercer and Lew Heinsling and Willie Brown and
himself—from Central City, and their meeting with their leader, Captain
Hardy, and the tedious watch for the German spies, lasting through
weeks, which began in upper Manhattan and ended in Staten Island.</p>

<p>And when Henry thought of the snug little headquarters they had had in a
private house in Staten Island, with a delightful elderly couple, he
jumped to his feet and almost shouted with relief. Why hadn’t he thought
of those old people before? They would take him in and tide him over
until his friends returned. They would be glad to see him again, too.
Henry felt sure of that, and, sighing with relief, he leaped to his
feet, seized his little suit-case, and hustled over to the near-by
municipal ferry-house, just in time to catch an outgoing boat for Staten
Island.</p>

<p>Eased in mind, he now eagerly watched the harbor, thrilling with the
stirring scenes before him. Six miles as the crow flies lay the course
across the bay to Staten Island, and this six miles was alive with
shipping. Everywhere vessels were moving. Sister ferry-boats were
ploughing the waves straight toward Staten Island. In the Hudson and the
East Rivers more ferry-boats were crossing back and forth. Big steamers
were moving majestically along. Tugboats without number churned the
choppy waves to foam, some riding in solitary state, and some towing
long strings of barges at the ends of great hawsers. Others were
snuggled in between big lighters, like porters with huge bandboxes under
each arm. In the anchorages below the Statue of Liberty great tramp
ships rode idly at anchor, awaiting cargoes. And on the opposite side of
the bay, below Governor’s Island, stately sailing ships rolled gently in
their moorings. Motor-boats, yachts, sailboats, even an occasional
rowboat, moved this way and that. The surface of the water was crossed
and recrossed with lines of yeasty foam, churned up by the passing
craft, while the air was vibrant with the ceaseless tooting of ships’
whistles.</p>

<p>And there was Governor’s Island, with its antiquated round fort, and the
ancient cannons atop of it. And farther along was the newly-made part of
the island, filled in with thousands of loads of material brought by
barges. On this made land now stood row upon row of government sheds and
warehouses erected during the war. And Henry recalled the still more
stirring scenes during those days of struggle, when every possible
anchorage was occupied, and the boats of the Coast Guard went rushing
about with their peremptory orders to incoming steamers, like traffic
police of the harbor, as indeed they were. And as his boat drew near the
ferry-house at St. George, Henry saw a Coast Guard cutter herself lying
at anchor close to the Staten Island shore. How trim and beautiful she
looked, in her shining white paint, with her flags flying, and her
motor-boat lying lazily alongside.</p>

<p>But now the great ferry-boat was coming to rest in her dock. The clank
of pawls, as the deck-hands made the huge craft fast, the lowering of
the gangways, and the hurried rush of feet, made Henry take his gaze
away from the fascinating harbor scene, for the crowd was moving and he
had to move with it. In another moment he had stepped ashore and found
himself outside the ferry-house.</p>

<p>An interesting place, indeed, was this St. George terminal. Henry had
journeyed on the upper deck of the ferry-boat, and now he found himself
in the upper part of the ferry-house. There were all the usual features
of a great waiting-room—long rows of seats, and news-stands, and
quick-lunch counters, and fruit-stands. None of these interested Henry.
His attention was centred on the scene without. The edge of the island
was a low-lying fringe of land, now given over wholly to shipping
facilities—great wharves and piers and wide roadways skirting the
water’s edge. Inland a few hundred yards the ground rose sharp and
steep, and these sloping terraces were covered with buildings. Skirting
the hilly heart of the island, roads wound downward, meeting directly in
front of the ferry building, and reaching that structure by a long,
sloping approach. These converging roads made Henry think of a huge
funnel, with the sloping ferry-approach as its small end. And the idea
of a funnel was carried out by the way this approach poured traffic into
the ferry-terminal. Trolley cars, motor cars, and pedestrians swarmed
down it in endless procession. Seemingly all the roads in Staten Island
converged at the upper end of this ferry-approach, and shunted their
burdens toward the crowded ferry-house.</p>

<p>Up this ferry-approach Henry made his way until he came to the end of
it, where it split into divergent roads. A moment he stood here, waiting
a favorable opportunity to cross the road. While waiting, he noticed a
man on the opposite curb, who was likewise held up by the traffic, and
who was evidently impatient of delay. Suddenly the man swung from the
curb and tried to worm his way across the thoroughfare, among the moving
vehicles. He had a bulging suit-case in one hand and a large package in
the other. Henry judged that he was hurrying to catch a boat.</p>

<p>The stranger was halfway across the street, when a recklessly driven
car, rushing up the ferry-approach, made the nearest drivers on the
upper roads swing sharply to one side. That caused all the traffic to
turn out. The man crossing the road was so laden with bundles that he
could not move quickly enough, and he was caught directly in front of an
oncoming motor truck. With a leap, Henry was at the pedestrian’s side.
Seizing him by the arm, he dragged him to safety. But the car in passing
knocked the parcel from the man’s arm and broke it open, scattering its
contents on the road. The car behind promptly stopped, blocking the
traffic. Henry snatched up the scattered contents of the parcel and
jumped back to the sidewalk. Then he took the suit-case himself, while
the stranger bundled the contents of the broken parcel under his arms,
and together they made their way to the ferry-house.</p>

<p>Henry’s companion was a heavy-set man of ruddy complexion, whose strong
face showed both firmness of character and kindness of spirit.</p>

<p>“That fellow would have got me sure,” he said indignantly, “if it hadn’t
been for you, sir. They ought to put about half of these motor-car
drivers in jail.”</p>

<p>“They’re pretty reckless,” Henry agreed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I am ever going to repay you,” said the man. “You
probably saved my life.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any pay,” said Henry. “If I really saved you from harm I
am glad.”</p>

<p>They reached the ferry-house, but, instead of entering, the man turned
to the right and went down a flight of steps. Then he walked across the
lower road to the very edge of the wharf, and out on a little float.
Henry saw at once that the man must belong on some one of the ships at
anchor near by, and was probably waiting for a small boat to meet him.</p>

<p>“If I can be of no further help to you,” said Henry, “I must be on my
way.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’m safe enough now,” laughed the man. “And I owe it to you
that I got here with a whole skin.” He thrust his hand into his pocket
and pulled out a little roll of bills. “Take these,” he said to Henry,
“and my best wishes.”</p>

<p>Henry looked at the money longingly, but only for a second. “I thank
you,” he said, “but I couldn’t do it, sir.”</p>

<p>“At least you will shake hands,” smiled the stranger, and he thrust out
his hand. Henry took the proffered hand, shook it warmly, and, saying
good-bye, turned on his heel. In a few moments he was back at the
crossing, and a second later he had gained the farther curb and was
absorbed in the study of the old town where he had spent such memorable
days.</p>

<p>But what a difference! This was not the town of St. George as he knew it
at all. How it had expanded and been built up. On every hand arose
unfamiliar buildings. From a little town the settlement had altered into
a city. Where once stood little cottages now arose great business blocks
or towering apartments. No longer was this a sleepy little island. It
was a pulsing part of a great city.</p>

<p>Rapidly Henry strode along, his pulse stirred, as always, by the
throbbing life of the great metropolis. On he went, and on and on, until
he came to the place where he should have seen the house of the German
spy. It was no longer there. A great row of apartments had replaced it.
And when Henry looked above, at the higher level where stood the house
in which he and his comrades had spent so many thrilling days, again he
saw a row of towering apartments. The house he was seeking no longer
existed.</p>

<p>The realization shocked him. He stopped in his tracks and stared. His
heart almost stood still. His last hope was gone. Then wildly he tore up
the roadway to the higher level, still hoping that he might find some
trace of the people he sought. His hope was vain. No name in any doorway
even remotely suggested the name he was looking for, and all whom he
questioned gave him the same reply,—they did not know any one of that
name.</p>

<p>Almost stunned, Henry turned about and slowly retraced his footsteps. He
was hardly conscious of where he was going, but he kept walking, and his
footsteps naturally went downhill. Before he realized where he was,
Henry found himself on the water-front. A great, wide, cobbled
thoroughfare ran along the water’s edge, and here, projecting far out
into the bay, stood pier after pier in a magnificent row, all built as a
result of the war. But the pulsing life of the war days was gone. Many
of the piers seemed empty or deserted. Few vessels lay in the docks. Yet
the splendid water-front, once open and unobstructed, was now completely
shut in by these hulking structures. To see the water here, one must
either go back up the hill, where one could see over the pier-sheds, or
else go to the seaward end of a pier. And no matter how keen his
disappointment was, Henry did want to see the water-front here. After a
little he would go back to Manhattan and try to find some quarters where
he could exist until one of his friends returned, or until he could get
a job. But before he went back he meant to have a good look at this
lower end of the harbor, which he loved so well.</p>

<p>Carefully he made his way along the edge of a pier, outside of the
pier-shed. It chanced to be unoccupied. Henry was glad it was so, for
there would be no one to disturb him. He could enjoy the scene to his
heart’s content. When he reached the outer end of the pier, he set his
little suit-case down and gave himself up to full enjoyment of the
scene. Not far below him were the buildings at the quarantine station,
and a great steamer lay in the Narrows there, evidently detained by the
quarantine officials. Here were no hurrying ferry-boats, but directly
off the pier on which he stood were anchored a number of ocean-going
craft. How huge they seemed. How alluring was the thought of a voyage
aboard one of them, even if they were but clumsy freighters. There was
nothing clumsy about the little Coast Guard cutter that lay near them,
however, and again Henry admired the trim little craft. He saw her small
boat returning from land with some passengers aboard, and he wondered at
her speed and the way she darted through the waves. He could even see
the man on watch, as he paced back and forth across the bridge.</p>

<p>Presently an ocean liner passed down the Narrows, headed for the open
sea. How majestically she rode the waves! Her rails were lined with
people. Henry wondered where they were going, and when they would be
coming back again. He watched the great ship until she began to grow
small in the distance. He was lost in thought, his mind with the
voyagers on the great vessel. There was not a soul about to disturb his
meditations. No one was on the pier, and no ships lay in the docks
alongside. How he wished he might take a journey abroad, like the
passengers on that great liner, and see distant lands and strange
peoples.</p>

<p>Unconsciously Henry had approached the very edge of the pier. He hardly
realized that only a foot or two of solid planking lay between him and
the heaving waters. His thoughts were entirely centred upon the
vanishing steamer. He wanted to watch her until he could see her no
longer. Her course turned her slightly toward the shore, behind some
pier-sheds and shipping farther down-stream. Henry craned his neck as
far as he could, to watch the disappearing vessel. Then he took one step
forward, and, as he did so, his toe caught under a spike which was
sticking up an inch or so in the flooring of the pier. He lost his
balance, and, before he could recover himself, pitched head foremost
over the end of the pier. Then, with no one near to aid him, with not a
soul to hear his startled cry for help, he sank far down into the cold
and heaving waters.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER II</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A FIGHT FOR LIFE</span>
</h2>

<p>So confused was Henry that he knew not in which direction to strike out.
He could not tell which way was up and which was down. He was afraid to
try to swim, lest he drive his body still deeper into the water, or swim
against a piling and perhaps knock himself unconscious. Instinctively he
had taken a deep breath just as he struck the water. It was fortunate,
for he was a long time coming up, and before his natural buoyancy lifted
him to the surface, he began to suffer for air. His lungs seemed to be
bursting. He felt as though he were suffocating. But just when it seemed
as though he could hold his breath no longer, his head shot up above the
water.</p>

<p>With a gasp Henry sucked in a lungful of air, and with it he gulped down
a mouthful of salt water. He began to cough and as he did so a choppy
wave hit him smack in the face and he swallowed more water. Although he
was an excellent swimmer, he was really in a bad way. All of his
swimming had been done in smooth, fresh water. He was not accustomed to
salt water and the roughness that usually accompanies it. With his face
drenched with the spray, his eyes stinging with the salt water, and the
choppy, uneven waves dashing over him, he knew not how to take care of
himself, or hardly in which direction to try to swim.</p>

<p>Indeed, it would have bothered even a more experienced person to know
just where to turn. The pier from which Henry had fallen contained not a
soul, and no boats lay in the long, flanking docks. It was useless to
look for help from that quarter. It was almost as useless to turn toward
the ships that lay at anchor some hundreds of yards out in the water.
Between them and the shore the tide was sweeping seaward with great
power. Even if he could manage to keep afloat, it would be almost
useless to swim toward these ships. He could never hope to stem that
strong current, and the chance of being seen by any lookout on the ships
seemed remote indeed to Henry. As for getting out of the water, there
seemed no possible chance of that either. There were no ladders, no
ropes, no steps visible anywhere along the piers, by which he could
mount upward. Only the rounded pilings that upheld the pier floors
offered space to cling to, and these were covered with rough barnacles
and coated with slime. Besides, it would do little good to cling to them
unless he could first attract the attention of some one.</p>

<p>With all his might Henry shouted, but he got no response. He was fast
becoming chilled, for the water was very cold. His strength was ebbing,
and the swirling eddies sucked him toward the pier. Once, indeed, he was
drawn entirely under the pier, and the choppy water knocked him roughly
against the pilings. His head banged hard against a great spile, and for
a moment Henry almost lost consciousness. Then he recovered his full
senses and set himself to fight for his life. His strength was going
fast, and he knew it. Yet he did not allow himself to become
panic-stricken. He took a grip on himself, turned away from the pier,
and struck out with all his remaining strength. Whatever happened, he
would get away from those deadly pilings. The thought of dying under the
pier, among those slimy spiles, chilled him worse than did the cold
water.</p>

<p>Incessantly the waves dashed in Henry’s face, blinding him. But he kept
his mouth shut and quickly learned to breathe guardedly, so he swallowed
little more water. Before him he could dimly distinguish the great black
bulk of an anchored ship. Even at the risk of being swept seaward, he
decided that he would try to swim to it.</p>

<p>Had it not been for his wet clothing and his shoes, which felt like
lead, Henry might have been able to make it. But his garments held him
back terribly. And so, though he continued to make headway, he was swept
swiftly along with the tide, out toward the open sea. From time to time
he shouted and waved a hand aloft, trying to attract attention. All at
once he realized that he could never gain his goal, and the thought
struck sudden terror to his heart. Still he struggled on, but his
strokes grew feebler and feebler. His vision became so confused he could
not see anything clearly. He was so utterly tired as to be almost
exhausted. Indeed, his movements had become almost mechanical, and he
had all but lost consciousness when he was startled by the sharp clang
of a bell and the noisy churning of water close at hand. Then something
took him by the coat-collar and he felt himself being bodily lifted out
of the waves. Again the bell clanged sharply, once more a propeller
churned the waters, and he felt himself moving swiftly over the tide.</p>

<p>It was a full minute before Henry could clear his brain and wipe his
eyes clean, so that he could see. He found himself in a powerful little
motor-boat, quite evidently built for use at sea, that was now scudding
along under full power direct toward the little white Coast Guard
cutter. Straight at the cutter charged the little craft. When it was
only a few yards distant, the bell clanged once more, the propeller
ceased to revolve, the little boat’s head came sharply about, and in
another moment the craft was resting beside the ship’s ladder.</p>

<p>“Can you make it alone?” asked one of the sailors in the boat, as Henry
rose to his feet and stepped on the landing-stage of the cutter.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Henry, who was already recovering his strength.</p>

<p>“Then up with you, quick.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Henry, “but first I want to thank you men for
saving me. I couldn’t have kept afloat much longer. You got to me just
in the nick of time. I don’t know what to say, to make you understand
how I feel.”</p>

<p>“Forget it,” smiled the sailor, “and hustle aboard. You’ll get pneumonia
if you stay there in the wind.”</p>

<p>Henry turned and started to mount the ladder. He noticed that one of the
sailors was close behind him, apparently ready to support him if he
needed help. But Henry was not now in need of assistance. His strength
was increasing every minute. He grasped the ladder-rail and mounted
upward, and when he looked ahead of him, he saw that the cutter’s rail
was lined with faces. Apparently the entire crew had been watching the
rescue.</p>

<p>As he reached the deck, Henry looked about him. Dozens of sailors, in
their strange blue uniforms, were gathered forward of the ladder. And
just aft of it stood a group of officers, looking very brave and trim in
their blue uniforms, with their gold-braided caps and their
gold-embroidered sleeves and shoulders. The captain looked especially
fine. He was a heavy-set man with a ruddy countenance. His uniform gave
him an air of real distinction. Somehow, his face looked familiar to
Henry, but it was not until the man spoke that Henry knew who he was.</p>

<p>“Bless my stars!” exclaimed the captain, when he had taken a good look
at Henry. “If it isn’t the lad who saved me from that old motor truck a
few hours ago!” Then, without a word to Henry, he said: “Hustle him down
to the fireroom, rub him briskly, fill him up with hot coffee, get him
some dry clothes, and, when you get him to sweating good, bring him to
my cabin. Now, step lively.”</p>

<p>And step lively those sailors did, too. They rushed Henry forward and
down a steep, iron ladder into the hottest room he had ever been in. And
they stripped off his clothes and rubbed him with rough towels until
they almost skinned him. Then they provided him with dry clothing.
Meantime a mess-boy brought steaming hot coffee from the cook’s galley,
and Henry drank cup after cup of it. Very grateful, indeed, was all this
warmth after his chilly bath. Yet it was some little time before Henry
was really warm. But presently he became more than warm. He grew hot.
Then beads of perspiration broke out on his body, and presently he was
sweating profusely. Meantime the ship’s surgeon had come into the
fireroom and examined his pulse, listened to his heart beat, and given
him some sort of a dose. Then the doctor led the way up to the deck and
along to the after companionway and so down to the captain’s cabin.</p>

<p>“Well, how are you feeling?” asked the captain, as Henry and the surgeon
entered the cabin, after knocking at the door.</p>

<p>“First rate,” laughed Henry, “but about as hot as a furnace itself.”</p>

<p>The captain chuckled. “That’s good news,” he said, “eh, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“The very best,” said the surgeon. “He’s all right, Captain. I think his
ducking will not hurt him a bit. He shows no sign of chill or shock or
any bad after-effect.”</p>

<p>“Very good, indeed. But keep your eye on him, Doctor. Now that we have
got him, we don’t want to lose him.”</p>

<p>The surgeon withdrew, leaving the captain and Henry alone in the little
cabin.</p>

<p>“Tell me, my boy,” said the captain, with great kindness, “how in the
world you ever got overboard. And, by the way, what happened to your
suit-case? Did you lose that overboard?”</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Henry. “I forgot all about that. It’s back on the pier that
I fell from. Is there any way I could get it?” And he began to look much
worried.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed about it,” replied the captain. “We’ll have it on
board in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>He stepped to the table in the centre of the cabin and pressed a
call-button that hung over it. An attendant instantly responded.</p>

<p>“Rollin,” said the captain, “tell Lieutenant Hill that this lad had a
suit-case, and that, unless some one has taken it, it is on the pier
from which he fell. Ask the lieutenant to see that it is recovered at
once.”</p>

<p>The attendant raced up the companionway, and a moment later Henry heard
the clang of the bell in the little motor-boat and the churning of her
propeller.</p>

<p>“I’m mighty sorry you fell overboard,” continued the captain, “but I’m
also mighty glad to welcome you aboard the <i>Iroquois</i>. After what you
did for me, it gives me the greatest pleasure to be of some slight
service to you. Now tell me something about yourself. What is your name?
And where do you come from? Seeing that you carry a suit-case, I judge
that you do not live in New York.”</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” said Henry. “My home is in Central City, Pennsylvania,
and my name is Henry Harper.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll shake hands, Henry. My name is Hardwick—Captain Hardwick.”
And he thrust out a muscular palm.</p>

<p>Henry shook the proffered hand. “I owe you my life,” he said. “I never
can thank you adequately, but please believe I am grateful to you.”</p>

<p>“Then we are quits. It is a case of tit for tat, isn’t it?” And the
captain smiled genially. “Now tell me what brings you to New York and to
Staten Island?”</p>

<p>“Well,” explained Henry, “I came over to New York to see an old friend
of mine, Willie Brown. He won a place in the Secret Service recently and
he promised to try to get me a job if I would visit him.”</p>

<p>The captain frowned ever so slightly. “So you have been bitten by the
detective bug, too, have you?” he said.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Henry. “I have no wish to be a detective, but I do
want a job. You see, sir, I was graduated from high school only last
June, and I want to get to work just as soon as I can. There do not seem
to be many very good jobs open to a fellow in a little town like Central
City.”</p>

<p>“I see. It always seems that way. Distance lends enchantment to view.
But never mind about that. What luck have you had here?”</p>

<p>“About the worst possible,” said Henry, with a grim laugh. “Willie
wasn’t in town, and won’t be for two or three weeks. And Roy Mercer,
another of my friends, who is wireless man on the <i>Lycoming</i>, is at sea
and won’t be in port for at least a week. And so I can’t find a soul I
know.”</p>

<p>“But what took you to Staten Island?”</p>

<p>Henry hung his head. “You see, Captain Hardwick,” he said slowly,
“I—I—didn’t exactly know what to do until Willie or Roy got back, and I
thought maybe I could find some friends in Staten Island. I came here
looking for them, but they have moved. It sort of upset me, and I went
down to the water-front to think what I should do. Then I fell
overboard.”</p>

<p>The captain looked at Henry searchingly. “You look big enough and
experienced enough to take care of yourself for a week, even in New
York. Why didn’t you go to a hotel and make yourself comfortable while
you waited for your friends?”</p>

<p>“I’d have been only too glad to do so, Captain, but you see—you see—I
came here expecting to be Willie’s guest—and I wasn’t prepared to—to——”</p>

<p>“Out with it,” said the captain. “You mean you haven’t the money, and
you were worried about how to get along.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly the case,” said Henry. “You see, Captain, my father is
dead, and I had to work while I went to school, so it put me behind a
little. Willie wanted to help me get a job, and he offered to take care
of me while I was here. I had enough money to pay my car fare here and
back, but that is about all. So you see I couldn’t very well go to a
hotel.”</p>

<p>“Well, bless my stars!” ejaculated the captain. “And you wouldn’t take a
cent from me this morning.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t, Captain. Would you take pay from me for saving my life just
now?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, but that’s different. Saving life is part of my job.
That’s what I’m paid for. Besides, I didn’t have a thing to do with it.
The man on watch saw you fall overboard, and I merely ordered out the
boat.”</p>

<p>“I can at least thank you for ordering out the boat. And I want to do
something to show my gratitude to the men who fished me out of the
water. I was almost gone when they got me, Captain Hardwick.”</p>

<p>Again the captain stepped to his call-bell. “Rollin,” he said, when the
attendant appeared, “tell Lieutenant Hill to send the crew of the
motor-boat to my cabin when they get back with this lad’s suit-case.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I think they are here now, sir.” And the attendant hurried up
the companionway.</p>

<p>A moment later three sailors appeared, one of them carrying Henry’s
suit-case. They came into the cabin and stood at attention.</p>

<p>Henry jumped to his feet. “I don’t know your names,” he said, “but my
name is Henry Harper. I want to thank you for what you did for me. If
you hadn’t got me, my mother would have been left all alone, without any
one to take care of her. I don’t know what to say to you, but please
believe that I am deeply grateful.”</p>

<p>The sailors were pleased, though they made light of the event. “Forget
it, kid,” one of them said. “It’s all in the day’s work.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll say it’s a pretty fine sort of work you men do,” replied
Henry. He shook hands heartily with his rescuers, and the three sailors
went tramping up to the deck.</p>

<p>“You told the truth, Henry,” said the captain, after the sailors had
gone, “when you said they were engaged in a fine sort of work. It is a
life full of hardships, this life of a Coast Guard, and yet the men love
it. If you are looking for a job, you can find an opening right in this
service.”</p>

<p>“What could I do?” asked Henry. “I don’t know a thing about the sea. I
don’t have any desire to be a mechanic, and so I wouldn’t make a good
engineer. And I really would not care to be a sailor.”</p>

<p>“You might become a wireless man, like your friend on the <i>Lycoming</i>.
You could doubtless learn to operate the wireless as well as he can.”</p>

<p>Henry smiled. “There wouldn’t be any trouble about the wireless,” he
said. “I’ve already worked for Uncle Sam as an operator.”</p>

<p>“The dickens you have! Tell me about it.”</p>

<p>And Henry told Captain Hardwick all about the Wireless Patrol, about the
capture by that patrol of the German dynamiters at Elk City, about the
hunt for the secret wireless right in Staten Island, and about his
serving as a substitute operator in the Frankfort wireless station.</p>

<p>The captain’s eyes opened wide as he listened to the story. “If there’s
anything in having plenty of good operators aboard, we ought to be safe
on this ship,” said the captain, “for you are going to stay here as my
guest until your friends get back to New York. Meantime, you can find
out a whole lot about the life on a Coast Guard cutter, and perhaps you
might decide to enter the service yourself.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it, Captain Hardwick?” asked Henry, his heart beating high
at the prospect.</p>

<p>“Certainly I mean it.”</p>

<p>“And shall we go to sea?” cried Henry.</p>

<p>“Indeed we shall. I received orders just a little while ago to destroy a
derelict that has been sighted off Nantucket Shoals. That’s what brought
me aboard. You see I live in Staten Island—when I’m home. I’m waiting
for my executive officer. The minute he comes aboard, we’ll hoist
anchor.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Captain,” cried Henry. “Won’t that be bully! I’ll be more
than glad to go. But I ought to let my mother know what has happened to
me. She’ll be worried when no letters come.”</p>

<p>“Entirely right,” said the captain. “Here’s my desk. You can write her a
letter whenever you wish. If there was any way to reach her by wireless,
we could send word to her at once from the ship.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Henry. “Of course I can. The fellows at home will be
listening in for me right after supper. We made that arrangement before
I left home. I expected to call them up on the outfit Willie uses at the
Secret Service headquarters.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the captain. “Then we’ll call it settled. And I hope
you’ll enjoy every minute of our trip.”</p>

</h2>

<p>So overjoyed was Henry at his sudden good fortune that he wanted to
throw up his hat and cheer. But he knew that would never do. To hide the
emotion that was struggling for expression, he stepped into the little
stateroom that the commander now indicated was to be his, and so keen
was his interest in this that he promptly forgot his desire to make a
noise.</p>

<p>The captain’s cabin was in the after part of the ship, and the little
staterooms, for there were two of them, occupied the very stern. These
staterooms were twin compartments, one for the captain and one for his
guests. A narrow passageway divided them. Each stateroom contained a
snug-looking bunk, with a round air-port, or window, just above it, like
a huge eye; and there was also a wardrobe, and a dresser with a mirror
above it. Each stateroom, likewise, led into a private bathroom, as
comfortably equipped as any similar room on land. The enormously high
sides of the bathtub at once caught Henry’s attention, and he rightly
guessed that these were to prevent water from slopping out of the tub
when the ship was plunging in the waves. As soon as he had examined his
quarters, he unpacked his little case, stowing his few articles of
clothing in the dresser. Then he stepped back into the cabin to have a
look at that.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the captain had gone on deck, and Henry was free to examine
things to his heart’s content. The cabin would have filled the heart of
any boy with delight. Occupying a cross section of the after part of the
ship, it reached from side to side of the vessel, with rows of round
air-ports on either side letting in air and light, and giving a view out
over the water. Along either wall, directly under these air-ports, were
leather-cushioned seats, where one could sit or lie at ease. In the
centre of the room was a square oak table, now covered with a soft green
felt cover. A sideboard was built into one side of the cabin, and Henry
was interested to note how all the goblets and dishes were secured so
that they could not fall from their places. Closets were also built into
the sides of the room, and one corner was occupied by the captain’s
desk, with his typewriter fixed on a movable shelf attached thereto.
Doors led mysteriously into other parts of the ship, one of which, Henry
later found, opened into the cabin of the captain’s steward or mess
attendant. And of course there were comfortable chairs and electric
lights everywhere, and books in a case, and some silver cups that Henry
found had been won by the crew of the <i>Iroquois</i> at the annual manœuvres
of the Coast Guard fleet at Cape May, and so many other snug and
interesting things that he thought this was indeed the most delightful
place he had ever been in. And now that the captain was not present, he
wanted more than ever to give a loud whoop or two.</p>

<p>It is altogether likely that he would have done so, too, had he not just
then heard the clang of the motor-boat’s bell alongside, and in another
moment footsteps sounded in the companionway. Then the captain entered
the cabin, followed by a tall, muscular-looking officer in full uniform.</p>

<p>“Mr. Harris,” said the captain, “this is my young friend, Henry Harper.
He is going to be my guest for a few days. Henry, this is my executive
officer, Mr. Harris.”</p>

<p>The two shook hands, and Henry knew at once that he was going to like
the tall, frank-looking sailor before him. Honesty was written all over
his face, and his wide-set blue eyes were as kindly as they were
fearless. The moment he had finished greeting Henry, he turned to his
chief expectantly.</p>

<p>“I just got a wireless order to destroy a derelict that was sighted off
Nantucket Shoals, well offshore. Suppose you ask the chief engineer to
get the ship under way at once, Mr. Harris.”</p>

<p>As the executive officer turned to go, the captain continued: “I don’t
like the looks of the weather. Fog may shut down at any moment. We want
to get out to sea before it catches us, if possible. So tell him to
drive her hard.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.” And the captain’s right-hand man stepped out of the
cabin.</p>

<p>“Henry,” said the captain, “I had better introduce you to the other
officers at once. I’ll be busy in a little while, and might forget about
it. Come into the wardroom with me.”</p>

<p>The captain was hard on the heels of the retiring executive officer.
Henry followed his host through the companionway door, but instead of
mounting the steps, the captain entered a second door directly opposite
his own at the foot of the staircase, and Henry, following, found
himself in the wardroom, or living-room, for the other commissioned
officers. This was immediately forward of the captain’s cabin, and was
not unlike it in size and furnishings. Several men in uniform sat about
a table in the centre of the room, reading magazines, playing solitaire,
or otherwise amusing themselves. All arose as the captain entered.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said the commander, “this is Henry Harper, who is to be my
guest for a few days.” Then the captain made Henry acquainted with each
man separately, naming them as Chief Engineer Farley, Lieutenant Hill,
Ensign Maxwell, and Dr. Drake, whom Henry had already met, although he
did not until this time know his name.</p>

<p>“We’re short-handed, as you see,” said the captain, “but I guess we’ll
manage to operate the ship anyhow.” And with a pleasantry or two, he
withdrew. The executive officer delivered the captain’s order, and all
the officers, hearing it, went to their stations.</p>

<p>“What did the captain mean when he said you were short-handed?” Henry
asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“Oh! We don’t have our full complement of officers. We lack a junior
engineer officer and a junior lieutenant. It makes it a little hard,
because the officers we do have must perform extra duty.”</p>

<p>While they were talking Henry suddenly became conscious of a curious
vibration in the ship, and a low, rumbling noise that filled the air. He
suspected that the ship’s propeller must be turning. The ensign
confirmed his suspicion when he said: “We’re moving. Would you like to
go on deck and see how we get under way?”</p>

<p>Henry did not know it, but the ensign was quite as eager to see as Henry
himself could possibly be. The ensign was fresh from the Coast Guard
Academy, and this was his first trip as a commissioned officer. Henry
was grateful for the courtesy, and gladly followed the young officer up
the companionway.</p>

<p>“Come up on the bridge,” said the ensign. “As the captain’s guest, you
will be free to go anywhere. We can see better there.”</p>

<p>Interesting as the sights about them were, the things to be seen on deck
were even more interesting to Henry. And he made his way forward very
leisurely, as he took the first good look at the <i>Iroquois</i> he had had
opportunity to take. He noted that the after-deck, from the companionway
to the taffrail, was entirely clear and open, and was roofed over with a
tightly stretched awning. Amidships towered the smoke-stack. And here,
too, was an array of skylights and ventilators, all open now, but so
arranged, Henry saw, that in time of rough weather they could be
securely battened down. And there were iron doors leading directly
downward into the bowels of the ship. One of them was the door through
which Henry had descended to the fireroom. Close by the after
companionway rose a stately mast. High up on it was the barrel-like
“crow’s-nest,” for a lookout aloft. And forward, just behind the
wheelhouse, towered a second mast, also with a crow’s-nest, and with
signal lamps on a cross-arm. Immediately Henry caught sight of the
wireless antennæ stretched between these two masts, and his practiced
eye noted every detail of the wiring, and traced the lead-in wire
downward to a room beneath the wheelhouse. Amidships, along either rail,
hung three or four lifeboats, swung outboard over the side of the ship,
and lashed fast to big horizontal spars or strongbacks with stout rope
shackles called gripes, so that they were held immovable, as in a vice.
And here and there along the rails circular life buoys were fastened or
“stopped” with short pieces of rope.</p>

<p>But before Henry could take in any more details, his companion had
mounted a ladder that led directly to the bridge, where the captain had
already taken his station.</p>

<p>The bridge was a steel structure, reaching from side to side of the
ship, and raised high above the deck, so that an unobstructed view could
be had of everything. It was railed in with strong, iron rails, reaching
breast-high. Stout canvas covers were fastened all around it, extending
from the floor almost to the level of the eyes, excepting immediately in
front of the wheelhouse, where they were fastened lower. This was the
weather cloth, to shut off the wind; and, as Henry was to learn, it was
a welcome aid to the navigator. Compasses were balanced on strong
pedestals at either side of the bridge, and there were various levers,
to use in blowing the ship’s siren, and for other purposes as well,
though, of course, Henry did not yet know what they were for, any more
than he understood that the Franklin metal life-belts, or buoys, that
hung at either end of the bridge could be dropped overboard by a single
motion of the hand, and that when they struck the water the
queer-looking tubes projecting from them would shoot out lights that
would burn for a long period, showing persons struggling in the sea
which way to swim for safety.</p>

<p>At present Henry was wholly engrossed in the action that was taking
place before him. The ship was moving gently through the water. The
anchor had been partly heaved up by the little hoisting engine on the
forward deck, but in heaving it, the chain had become twisted around one
of the movable flukes, so that the stem of the anchor could not be
properly heaved in through the hawse hole. A warrant officer in uniform,
and a small group of sailors, leaned over the bow rail, trying to
release the fouled anchor. A slender rope ladder had been lowered over
the side, and on this a sailor was creeping down to the anchor that hung
partly in the water, with a small rope in his hand. The rope he
cautiously slipped around a fluke, so that the anchor could be tilted
up.</p>

<p>“That’s the boatswain, Mr. Johnson,” said the ensign, indicating the
warrant officer in charge of the sailors.</p>

<p>Presently the anchor was freed. The boatswain signaled to the man at the
hoisting engine, and slowly the huge anchor-chain was heaved taut, with
the flukes of the anchor drawn up tight against the hawse hole. The
moment the anchor was lifted free of the water, the boatswain notified
the captain, who immediately signaled the engineer to crowd on steam. At
once the vibration of the ship became more noticeable. Faster and faster
she began to surge through the water, and presently she was steaming at
top speed toward the open sea.</p>

<p>On some other occasion, perhaps, Henry would have centred his attention
on the views without, but now he was wholly occupied with the mysteries
of this wonderful ship, so he paid slight heed to the wonderful sights
in the Narrows, and gladly followed the ensign when the latter suggested
that they step inside.</p>

<p>They entered the wheelhouse, a tiny room just behind the bridge, where a
sailor stood at the wheel, steering the ship in accordance with the
captain’s low-spoken orders. Immediately they passed through a door into
the chart-room. This was somewhat larger than the wheelhouse, though
tiny at best. On a large shelf or table lay a number of charts, some
dividers, pencils, erasers, sliding rules, and some binoculars. In a
rack on the wall were various code-books and books of instructions to
navigators. Lieutenant Hill was erasing some lines from a chart. A
moment later the captain stepped in. The two consulted the chart, and
made some measurements with the sliding rule.</p>

<p>“Our course is east, three-quarters south,” said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Very good,” replied the captain. “Mark it on the chart.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant laid his rule along the course indicated, and drew a line
on the chart, while the captain stepped into the wheel room.</p>

<p>“Keep her east, three-quarters south,” he said to the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir. East, three-quarters south,” answered the helmsman.</p>

<p>“We’re laying a course direct for Ambrose Lightship,” said the
lieutenant to Henry. “After we reach that we will head directly for the
location of the derelict.”</p>

<p>Presently, as he heard a thin, shrill whistle piping on deck, Henry
turned to the ensign.</p>

<p>“What was that?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“That’s the boatswain’s mate piping mess gear.”</p>

<p>“That’s all Greek to me,” laughed Henry.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the nautical term for the call to table. The whistle blows
ten minutes before meal time, and the men, except those who must remain
on duty, must wash for supper. See them scurrying to get ready? Meals
are served at seven-twenty, noon, and five at night. So it’s ten minutes
of five now.”</p>

<p>Henry was watching the sailors hurrying below, when a hand was laid on
his shoulder. “Well, youngster,” said the captain’s kindly voice, “it’s
time that you and I got washed up, too, or Rollin will be in our wool.”</p>

<p>Thanking the ensign for his kindness, Henry followed the commander to
the deck and then down the companionway to the cabin. What he saw made
Henry open his eyes wide. A snowy table-cloth had replaced the green
felt table-cover, and the square little table was beautifully set for
two.</p>

<p>“You’ll find towels in your bathroom,” said the captain. “And if
anything is missing, just ring for Rollin and he will bring it to you.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the captain and Henry sat face to face at the small
table, and Henry was enjoying one of the pleasantest meals he had ever
had.</p>

<p>Night was approaching when the meal was ended. “I must be getting my
message off to my mother,” said Henry.</p>

<p>“Surely,” assented the commander. “We mustn’t forget that. Come with me
and we’ll go get acquainted with Sparks.”</p>

<p>“Sparks?” queried Henry.</p>

<p>“Oh! That’s our pet name for Harry Sharp, the chief electrician. He has
charge of all the electrical apparatus as well as the wireless itself.”</p>

<p>They found the chief electrician in the wireless house, for it was his
trick at the key. “Mr. Sharp,” smiled the captain, “this is Henry
Harper. He’s taking a little trip with us, and maybe he’ll be a Coast
Guard man himself some day. Just now he wants to send a message to his
friends at home, so that his mother won’t be alarmed about him. Will you
help him out?”</p>

<p>Henry’s eyes shone bright as he looked about the small wireless room.
There was a broad, desk-like shelf that stretched from side to side of
the little room, and on this, and on the walls about him, were fastened
a dazzling array of wireless instruments.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Henry. “What a peach of an outfit!”</p>

<p>“It ought to be,” said the chief electrician with a smile. “It’s right
up-to-date, and it cost Uncle Sam ten thousand dollars. Know anything
about wireless?”</p>

<p>“A little,” said Henry. “I served as a substitute operator at the
government station at Frankfort for a time.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to send your own message?”</p>

<p>“Would I? Gee! I should say so.”</p>

<p>“All right. Sit down here and let’s see what you can do. Call up your
station.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Henry. “Will you set her for two hundred and fifty
meters, please?”</p>

<p>The electrician twirled his thumbscrews. Henry tested the key for a
moment, then threw over the switch and sent his call speeding through
the night: “<b>CBWC—CBWC—CBW</b>C—de—<b>CBE</b>.”</p>

<p>“You send well,” said the chief electrician.</p>

<p>For a few moments the two operators sat, their phones clamped to their
ears, listening intently. There was no response.</p>

<p>“<b>CBWC—CBWC—CBWC</b>—de—<b>CBE</b>,” once more rapped out Henry.</p>

<p>This time there came a faint answer: “<b>CBE—CBE—CBE</b>—de—<b>CBWK—K</b>.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got ’em,” commented the electrician. “Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Reached New York all right,” wired Henry. “Both Willie and Roy out of
town. Made the acquaintance of Captain Hardwick, of the Coast Guard
cutter <i>Iroquois</i>. Am going to sea for a short trip as his guest. We are
now in Lower New York Bay, heading for Ambrose Lightship. We are to find
a derelict and destroy it. Please tell mother to write me in care of
Captain Hardwick. Will send her a letter as soon as we get back.”</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Then the receivers began to buzz again. “Your
mother is here,” came the message. “Wants to know more about your trip.”</p>

<p>Henry turned to his companion. “They are talking from the workshop in
our back yard,” he explained. “It’s headquarters for our wireless club.
We call it The Camp Brady Wireless Patrol. They’ve called mother out to
the shop.”</p>

<p>Then he pressed the key again. “Tell her I’ll write,” he flashed back,
and turning again to the chief electrician, he said with a grin: “Gee!
I’d never dare tell her that I fell overboard. She’d have a fit and
order me right home.”</p>

<p>“Where can we get you?” came another query.</p>

<p>“Call the <i>Iroquois</i>.” Once more Henry faced his companion. “What is our
call signal?” he asked.</p>

<p>“<b>NTE</b>,” was the reply.</p>

<p>And Henry hastily added to his message: “Our call is <b>NTE</b>. Can send no
more. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” he exclaimed, as he laid down the receivers. “Won’t my chums be
an astonished bunch! It was almost worth falling overboard to give ’em
such a surprise! And won’t they envy me! I’m going to have the time of
my life.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chIV' title='IV: THE WATCH IN THE DARK'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER IV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE WATCH IN THE DARK</span>
</h2>

<p>The chief electrician was on watch for four hours, and Henry sat with
him in the wireless shack, as the radio room on the <i>Iroquois</i> was
called, until his watch was ended. Together they caught the nightly
news-letters sent out by the various press associations. They heard
myriads of commercial messages flashing through the air. At times the
operator switched on the radio, and then, through the loud speaker, they
heard some of the broadcasting programmes. Henry had told the truth when
he said he was having the time of his life. Never had he seen such a
wonderful wireless outfit as this one, for the Frankfort station
equipment, which he had operated many months before, was naturally far
from being the equal of these brand-new instruments.</p>

<p>Shortly before the chief electrician’s watch ended, the door of the
wireless shack opened, and a sailor stepped within. At least, the lad
was dressed like a sailor, though when Henry saw the red electric sparks
embroidered on the young man’s blue sleeve, he judged that this must be
the wireless relief. And so it proved, for the chief electrician at once
said, “Mr. Harper, this is one of my assistants, Mr. Black.”</p>

<p>Henry thought the newcomer was well named. The fellow had a surly look,
and his eyes were shifty. He was one of those individuals that never
looks another squarely in the eye. But Henry jumped to his feet, thrust
out his arm, and took the other’s limp hand in greeting.</p>

<p>“I am very glad to know you, Mr. Black,” he said. “We fellows back in
the country have played at being wireless men, and it’s a great pleasure
to meet real wireless operators.”</p>

<p>A sudden roll of the ship sent Henry reeling back against the wall of
the wireless shack, and he realized what he had not noticed while he was
still seated and engrossed in the wireless, namely, that the sea was
evidently becoming rough. Henry would have been glad to stay on watch
with this new operator, but the latter drew a soiled dime novel from his
blouse and tilted back in his chair to read, utterly regardless of the
fact that a visitor was present. The chief electrician frowned but said
nothing. And Henry, seeing his presence was not desirable, turned to the
chief operator.</p>

<p>“Would there be any objection to my looking about the deck?” he asked.
“I’ve never been on a ship at sea before, and I’d like to know what it
is like at night on deck.”</p>

<p>“Just come up on the bridge,” said the wireless man. “There’s nobody on
deck, probably, but the man on watch in the bow. You’ll find Mr. Hill
and the quartermaster on watch on the bridge. Maybe you’d like to stand
watch yourself a while. Would you?”</p>

<p>“I’d be tickled to death,” exclaimed Henry.</p>

<p>“Then come to our quarters and I’ll fit you out. You’ll find it pretty
chilly up on the bridge.”</p>

<p>Henry turned to say good-night to the assistant operator. The latter
already had his nose buried in his novel. Henry could not help but
notice how the fellow’s fingers were stained with tobacco, and what an
evil look seemed to lurk on his countenance. He did not disturb him, but
quietly followed Mr. Sharp out of the wireless shack. “I’d hate to trust
the safety of the ship to a man like that,” he thought, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>The instant the door was opened, his attention was drawn to other
things. Across the deck an icy blast of wind was sweeping that made
Henry shiver. From above came an eerie, humming, vibrating noise, as the
rigging quivered in the breeze. Only soft lights were visible—such
indirect illumination as shone through ports or windows or the deck
lights,—discs of heavy glass set flush in the planking underfoot to let
the sunlight into the interior of the ship. Aloft twinkled the ship’s
sailing lights. Beyond the rails all was inky darkness, and it was a
darkness that seemed almost to be alive. Out of it came sounds such as
Henry had never heard before—the swish and sweep of swaying waters, the
crashing of crested waves, the interminable roar of endless leagues of
rolling billows.</p>

<p>Henry was amazed to find how the ship was moving up and down. He tried
to imitate the wireless men, who skipped quickly around the after end of
the wireless shack, but a lurch of the ship sent him flying across the
deck. He brought up with a jolt at the leeward rail. With a chuckle he
turned about and made for the door of the operator’s stateroom which the
electrician was now holding open for him. A broad band of light
illumined his way.</p>

<p>As Henry stepped through the doorway, he could see quite well what a
snug little place this stateroom was. Three bunks, one above the other,
occupied most of one side of the compartment. There were also a tall
wardrobe, a washbowl with mirror above it, and a table with several
chairs. On this table were a number of books and magazines. A young man
sat at the table, his elbows on the edge of it, his chin propped on his
hands, so deeply engrossed in a book he was reading that he was
unconscious of the entrance of Henry and Mr. Sharp. By the device on the
young man’s sleeve Henry saw that he, too, was an assistant wireless
man.</p>

<p>“Jim,” said the chief electrician.</p>

<p>The reader looked up, startled. Then he laid down his book and arose.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Harper,” said the electrician. “Mr. Harper, this is my
other assistant, Jim Belford.”</p>

<p>Henry was sure he would like this young man. The lad had a fine face,
and intelligence showed in his every feature. His smile was frank and
winning. The two shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>“So you’re going to sea with us,” said the lad. “Are you a good sailor?
It looks as though we’d have some rough water by morning.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Henry. “I’ve never been to sea before. I suppose
I shall know before long.” Then, his eye falling upon the book the young
operator had laid down, Henry said, “Don’t let me keep you from your
reading. You appeared to have something interesting.”</p>

<p>The lad passed the book to Henry. “It is very interesting,” he said. And
when Henry examined the volume in his hand, he found that it was a
treatise on electricity. He couldn’t help thinking of the contrast in
the reading matter chosen by the two young operators.</p>

<p>“You must have lots of time for reading,” commented Henry, “and this is
an excellent way to use it.” He handed back the book.</p>

<p>“We are on watch four hours and off duty for eight, so we have oceans of
time, and I’m glad of it. I wasn’t able to finish my high-school course,
and I’m trying to go on with my education. There’s a good chance to work
up in this service if a fellow will only take it.”</p>

<p>“How do you get a job in the Coast Guard anyway?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“The officers, of course, attend the Coast Guard Academy at Fort
Trumbull, up in Connecticut. It’s just like West Point or Annapolis. It
trains the officers for the Coast Guard ships. Everybody else gets his
job by enlistment.”</p>

<p>“Are there good openings? Could I, for instance, get a position?”</p>

<p>“You could enlist as a seaman, or you could enlist for wireless duty if
you know anything about wireless.”</p>

<p>“He does,” smiled the chief electrician.</p>

<p>“The Chief, here, would examine you. If he passed you, you’d become an
assistant wireless man and rank as a third-class petty officer. This
first examination is quite simple. You must be able to send and receive
adequately and know how to handle your instruments, and that is about
all you need to know to pass it. Three months after you become a
third-class man, you could take another examination, and if you passed
that, you’d become a second-class petty officer. This second examination
would deal with wireless theory and codes and the semaphore and
blinkers.” And noting Henry’s blank expression, the young wireless man
continued, “You noticed the semaphores on the yardarm on the forward
mast, didn’t you? And the lights there?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Henry.</p>

<p>“Well, we no longer use flags when we semaphore. We use the semaphores
up on the yardarms. At night we use those lights or blinkers and make
’em wink by electricity. It’s really sending wireless messages with
lights instead of sound waves.”</p>

<p>“And how does a fellow become a first-class radio man?”</p>

<p>“To become a first-class man, you’d have to have a good knowledge of all
parts of the ship, and all radio laws and regulations and general radio
procedure. You could take your examination nine months after you entered
the service, but there are mighty few radio men who are ready to take it
so soon.”</p>

<p>“What about Mr. Sharp here? He is chief electrician. How long does it
take to become a chief electrician?”</p>

<p>“It would take at least three years to make that. You have to know an
awful lot to become a chief electrician.” The lad paused, then added
simply: “That’s what I am working for. Most fellows that qualify as
wireless men have a high-school education. You see, I couldn’t finish my
course. It’s an awful handicap to me now.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been through high school,” said Henry, and to himself he thought:
“I’m certainly glad mother held me to it. I can see already what a
difference it may make to me.” A moment later he said to the chief
electrician: “I hadn’t any idea of ever belonging to the Coast Guard,
but for a long time I have wanted to be a wireless man. Do you suppose
there would be any chance for me on the <i>Iroquois</i>?”</p>

<p>“We have our full complement now,” said Mr. Sharp. “There wouldn’t be
any opening on this boat unless we could get rid of—unless one of my
assistants should leave.”</p>

<p>Henry looked sharply at the chief electrician. He believed he knew
exactly what the wireless chief had started to say, and he believed it
had to do with the man now on watch in the wireless shack. But of course
Henry made no comment. “I’d like mighty well to be a Coast Guard radio
man,” he said. After a moment’s pause he went on: “Won’t you please
explain to me again about the officers? You said they were trained at
the Coast Guard Academy. And you also said a fellow could enlist as a
wireless man and yet rank as an officer. I don’t exactly understand.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder,” laughed the young wireless man. “You see there are
three sorts of officers—petty officers, warrant officers, and
commissioned officers. The captain of a ship appoints the petty officers
from the enlisted crew. Petty officers are men like the boatswain’s
mate, the chief yeoman, the gunner’s mate, and the like. From among
these the captain chooses men he will recommend for appointment as
warrant officers. They get their appointments from Washington. The
boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and others are warrant officers.
The commissioned officers are the trained navigators from the Coast
Guard Academy, and bear the nation’s own commission as officers.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Henry. “It’s very plain now.”</p>

<p>Meantime Mr. Sharp had been searching in the wardrobe. He now handed a
thick sweater to Henry, and when the lad had pulled it on and buttoned
his coat over it, the chief electrician produced a long, warm overcoat,
which he made his visitor put on. Then, pulling on a long rain-proof
overcoat himself, he led the way out of the cabin. Henry said good-bye
to the young radio man, to whom he had taken a great liking, and
followed the Chief.</p>

<p>Up to the bridge they mounted, and Henry was glad, indeed, that he was
so warmly clothed. The wind swept past so fiercely that he could hardly
get his breath when he faced it. A light was burning in the chart house.
In the glass-fronted wheelhouse the compass was dimly illuminated.
Otherwise it was dark. A figure stood within, silent, almost immovable,
his arms grasping the handles of the steering wheel. As Henry peered
into the wheelhouse, he saw that the steersman’s eye was on the compass.
He was holding the ship true to her course—east three-quarters south.</p>

<p>On the bridge itself two human forms loomed in the darkness. Lieutenant
Hill was standing on the port side. He said, “Good-evening,” as Henry
stepped alongside him, then continued his vigil, looking steadily into
the blackness of the night. When Henry crossed to the starboard side of
the boat, he found Quartermaster Andrews also peering intently out over
the weather-cloth. The chief electrician made them acquainted. Henry
came up close to the rail and thrust his face out over the
weather-cloth, but he drew it back in a hurry. The stinging blast struck
him with sudden fury. He winked as though something tangible had hit
him. Then he made a wild and fruitless grab at his hat, which the wind
had torn from his head. The hat lodged against the wheelhouse and he
rescued it.</p>

<p>“I had no idea it was blowing so hard,” he said to the quartermaster,
“and I wouldn’t have believed that weather-cloth would be such a
protection. Why, six inches behind it you can hardly feel any wind at
all. It seems to shoot the breeze straight upward.”</p>

<p>The quartermaster smiled. “You’re right about the weather-cloth,” he
said, “but this isn’t much of a wind yet. It looks as though we might
have a gale before morning, though, and if we do you’ll have a good
chance to see how the <i>Iroquois</i> behaves in a rough sea. We’ll be in
shallow water for some hours yet, and it always gets rough out here when
there is any wind.”</p>

<p>“I should think a fellow would freeze up here in real cold weather when
it blows hard. It’s cold enough now. How do you ever stand it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got on one of those wind-proof suits,” said the quartermaster. “It
takes a pretty stiff gale to go through that.” And Henry, looking close,
saw that his companion was dressed in a hooded blouse that had to be
pulled on over the head, and that could be fastened tight about his
head, so that only the face was exposed. The quartermaster also wore a
knitted, blue watchcap that he could pull down over his ears.</p>

<p>When Henry stared into the dark void ahead of and around them he could
at first see nothing. The sky was like a dome of black. No star, no
feeblest ray of light of any sort, came from it. And the water beneath
was its twin for darkness. Overhead the rigging sang ever more eerily,
and, when the wind rose in sharp crescendo, the cordage fairly shrieked.
The woodwork creaked and groaned. From every side came the tumultuous
roar of the waves, a sound so overpowering, so insistent, so awesome,
that Henry shuddered when he listened to it. A feeling almost of fear
came to him. He could not help thinking how awful it would be if the
ship should sink in such a wild waste of water. But when he glanced at
the motionless figure in the wheelhouse, and when he thought of the
radio, he was reassured. But he would have felt safer, he thought to
himself, if young Belford or the chief electrician had been on watch in
the wireless shack.</p>

<p>Already the latter had left the bridge and returned to his cabin. But
Henry stayed on the bridge a long time. Occasionally he spoke briefly to
the officers on watch, but mostly he watched in silence, peering into
the darkness, drinking in the sounds of the night, filling himself with
new sensations, not all of which were pleasant, for as the wind came
ever stronger, and the ship rose and fell more noticeably, a strange
feeling crept over Henry. He began to feel queer about his stomach.</p>

<p>“I must have indigestion,” he muttered to himself. “Maybe I ate
something that didn’t agree with me.”</p>

<p>He kept getting sicker and sicker. Soon he suspected that he was
seasick. Finally he could stand it on the bridge no longer. Trying hard
to control himself, he said good-night to Lieutenant Hill, and made his
way with trembling limbs down the ladder to the deck. Like a drunken man
he went reeling aft, for the ship was beginning to roll. When he reached
the after companionway, he felt worse than ever, for the motion was much
more noticeable than it had been forward or amidship. He could stand it
no longer. Making his way unsteadily to the leeward rail, he leaned over
it and vomited. He had never felt so sick in his life. Every minute he
seemed to feel worse. He was so weak he was afraid he would fall over
the rail. He decided that he would try to get to his bunk.</p>

<p>He turned and started toward the companionway, when the ship rolled far
over on her side. As though he were shot out of a cannon Henry went
plunging across the deck. There was nothing he could grasp to stop
himself. With terrific force he went crashing into the windward rail and
was flung partly over it. With all the power at his command he clung to
the rail as he balanced on top of it. For a moment his heart almost
ceased to beat. He was afraid he was going overboard. His feet were
clear of the deck. His body was half over the rail. All he could do was
to cling fast, in the hope that he wouldn’t slide any further. But his
position was so awkward he was fearful he could not keep himself from
plunging on over into the sea. Suddenly the ship heeled in the other
direction. Henry was flung back from the rail as violently as he had
just shot into it. This time he struck the companionway. He grasped the
door, opened it, took a grip on the handrail, and tottered down the
steps. He found the captain’s cabin deserted. The commander had to go on
watch later in the night, and was sleeping in preparation for it. Henry
got to his stateroom, undressed, pulled on his nightclothes, and with a
feeling of relief slid into his bunk. He had lost all interest in the
sea and wireless and derelicts. His one hope now was that he would live
until the <i>Iroquois</i> got back to port and he could get ashore.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER V</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DERELICT</span>
</h2>

<p>Henry awoke early next morning. At first he did not know where he was.
Then he remembered all. But life no longer looked sable. Indeed, there
was a rosy tinge to it, just as there was about the eastern sky. The
feeling of nausea had entirely left him. Gone were the terrible headache
and the feeling of sickness that had affected his entire body. Though
the ship was now rolling far more than it had rolled the preceding
night, the motion no longer distressed him. He rose and dressed quickly.</p>

<p>Early as Henry was, the captain was up before him. The captain had taken
his turn on the bridge, then snatched a little more sleep, and was now
busy at some clerical work at his desk. He looked up as Henry stepped
into the cabin.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, youngster,” he said. “How are you feeling? Didn’t make
you sick, did it? There’s a pretty good sea going.”</p>

<p>“It made me sick as a dog,” admitted Henry, “but I’m fit as a fiddle
now. A good sleep fixed me up.”</p>

<p>They ate breakfast and went to the chart-room. Though the ship was far
out in the ocean, it was still many hours’ sail from the location given
for the derelict. The captain began to study the ship’s logbook, as the
sailing record is called.</p>

<p>“See here, Henry,” he remarked after a moment. “This logbook might
interest you.” Henry looked at the book, and saw entered there a
detailed record of what was done on shipboard, not only from hour to
hour but even every few minutes. Glancing back, he saw that his own
rescue was noted down, and the recovery of his suit-case, and the exact
time the executive officer came aboard, as well as the time when the
<i>Iroquois</i> got under way.</p>

<p>“Captain Hardwick,” he said presently, “what does this entry about the
log mean? I see it is written down every hour.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way we keep our dead reckoning,” said the captain. “When we
can see sun or stars, we know exactly where we are. But when it’s cloudy
we have to figure our position by dead reckoning. We know by our compass
which way we are heading. We can tell by the number of revolutions of
our propeller how fast we ought to be moving. We have an apparatus
fastened to the taffrail that drags in the sea a good many fathoms
behind us, and that turns like a propeller. It turns the line with it.
The line is on a swivel, and every revolution is recorded on an
instrument like a speedometer. When we look at that instrument we can
tell how many miles we have made. The quartermaster reads the log every
hour and records the reading in this book. So we can tell pretty exactly
how many miles we have traveled. We also know in what direction we went.
But we can’t always tell how far wind and current have put us out of our
true course. We make allowance for them when we figure our dead
reckoning. Usually we hit it pretty closely. But if there comes a period
when sun and stars are hidden for two or three weeks, as sometimes
happens, a ship’s captain may be miles from where he thinks he is. Why,
once we went after a steamer that sent an SOS for help, and we had a
terrible time to find her because she was seventy miles from where she
thought she was, and where we went to get her.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” said Henry. “How did you ever find her?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to tell you that some other time, Henry. I’m too busy just
now.”</p>

<p>Henry went out on the bridge, so as to leave the captain undisturbed. It
was still windy and cold, but the day fairly sparkled. The sun shone
through a cloudless sky. The waves gleamed and flashed in its brilliant
beams. As one spellbound Henry gazed at the scene. Always he had tried
to picture to himself what the ocean looked like. Now he knew that to
picture the ocean mentally one must first actually see it. This great,
boundless, inconceivable body of water was too vast for the imagination
alone to picture. Turn in which direction he would, Henry could see
nothing but water. And this water was rolling and tossing and surging
and splashing and leaping in a manner past description. Never before had
Henry seen waves higher than those in the Hudson River and the New York
Bay. He had read of the huge waves of the ocean, but what he now saw,
though they were far from being of the largest size, awed and impressed
him. He felt sure some of them must be ten feet high. The ensign, who
had now come on watch, assured him that they were all of that.</p>

<p>No matter where he looked, Henry saw nothing but water, leagues and
leagues of tossing billows, the bluish-green depths spotted everywhere
with the yeasty white of foaming wavecrests. No ship was in sight. Land
was many miles behind them. Not even a bit of driftwood broke the vast
expanse of the heaving ocean. The only object that rose above those
miles and miles of furious billows was the <i>Iroquois</i> herself. How tiny,
how puny, how insignificant, she seemed in that vast wilderness of
water. For a moment a creepy feeling again stole over Henry. Suppose
something should happen to the ship. Suppose she should sink. What
chance would her crew, mere pigmies, have with these giant combers? But
when Henry thought of the wireless, a feeling of courage surged through
his heart again, and he was thankful to the men who had labored to make
the wireless possible, and thankful that he was a wireless man himself.
What a wonderful thing it was, he thought, to be able to call help or to
catch the cry of those who needed help. Assuredly, the wireless man
carried the safety of untold lives in his hands, just as truly as the
captain of the ship did. How proud an operator ought to be, and how
faithful he ought to be to his trust. And again Henry frowned as he
thought of the lad he had last seen on watch in the wireless shack.</p>

<p>Long before the <i>Iroquois</i> reached the spot where the derelict had been
seen, the captain had ordered a watch in the crow’s-nests; and for two
hours at a time a man stood in each of these elevated lookouts,
searching the seas for some trace of the lost vessel. But the spot where
she had been seen was reached without the discovery of a single trace of
her.</p>

<p>The captain was not in the least disturbed. He had had no expectation of
finding her so soon. Wind and wave would have carried the hulk leagues
to leeward of the spot. It was up to the captain to find her. When Henry
stepped into the chart-room again, he found the captain plotting on his
chart the course he intended to follow in his search for the derelict.</p>

<p>When he noticed that Henry was watching him, the captain said: “That’s
what is called a grid. You see we start here, where the derelict was
known to be some days ago, and we steer a course that will enable us to
view the sea over a wide area. We try to follow the course we think the
derelict has taken.”</p>

<p>“But how could you know which way a wreck would go?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“If the derelict stuck up above water much, it would go in the direction
of the wind rather than the water,” said the captain. “If it is mostly
submerged, it would go in the direction the water was flowing. I’m going
to assume that this derelict has been driven by the wind, for we’ve had
this high southwest wind for nearly a week. So we’ll cover a broad belt
of sea along her supposed course.”</p>

<p>“But how can you tell where that course is? I should think you’d get
lost in this endless wilderness of water. There are no landmarks to help
you know where you are.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong, young man. There’s the greatest landmark in the world,
right up there.”</p>

<p>Henry looked overhead. “I see nothing but the sun,” he said.</p>

<p>“That’s all a navigator needs to see,” laughed the captain. “It’s just
as I told you. As long as he can see the sun, or the stars, you can’t
lose him. When he looks at either through a sextant, he can tell exactly
where he is.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Henry. “The sun tells you your latitude and longitude.”</p>

<p>“Correct. That dot on the chart,” and the captain pointed with his
pencil, “is the spot where this derelict was reported to be. Also it’s
just where we are now. If I drew a mark from that dot along the
direction in which the wind is blowing, which is from the southwest,
that should be the course of the derelict. But the current may have
carried it to right or left of that line. So we have to make a grid, in
order that we may not pass the derelict in our search. We will sail a
course that takes us first to right and then to left of this supposed
course, in such a way that we can examine every foot of the sea over a
wide area. Our present grid will be like this;” and the captain drew on
a piece of paper a diagram something like the following:</p>

<div style='margin-left:10%; width:80%; padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em;' >
 <img src='images/illus-086.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
</div>

<p>“We are now at A,” he said. “We’ll run off to starboard a distance, then
make a right-angled turn to port, and on around so as to make a series
of long rectangles, as it were. The sides of these rectangles will be as
far apart as twice the supposed limit of visibility. Thus we shall be
able to see everything that floats within the limits of our course.”</p>

<p>“How far do you think you could see this derelict?” said Henry.</p>

<p>“Not so very far. We are looking for an old, wooden schooner. Her masts
are gone and her decks are awash. At least that is what she was like
when sighted. She wouldn’t stick up above the water much, and this sea
may have broken her in pieces. We might be able to see her five miles,
so the sides of our rectangles couldn’t be much more than twice that
distance apart.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fine scheme,” agreed Henry, “and I’ll bet you’ll find her.”</p>

<p>Already the <i>Iroquois</i> had come about and was standing on the first leg
of the grid. Hour after hour the cutter continued its search, covering
leg after leg of the course. But neither the men on the bridge nor the
lookouts in the crow’s-nests could detect any particle of wreckage.</p>

<p>Meantime the chief electrician had been combing the seas with his
wireless, asking all vessels that had seen the derelict to give the
<i>Iroquois</i> what information they had concerning it.</p>

<p>Every three or four hours he kept broadcasting this message: “<i>Iroquois</i>
searching for derelict schooner. Last reported September 25 in latitude
thirty-nine, thirty; longitude sixty-six, twenty. Any vessel sighting
derelict please notify Coast Guard cutter <i>Iroquois</i>. Call letters NTE.”</p>

<p>And Henry, listening in at times, caught several messages like this:
“NTE—NTE—NTE—de—KLF—Your QST acknowledged. Will keep sharp lookout. AR.”</p>

<p>“How wonderful wireless is,” thought Henry. “By means of it we can
enlist every pair of eyes on the near-by ocean.”</p>

<p>But the search by wireless was quite as fruitless as that by steam. No
trace of the lost schooner could be found. All day the <i>Iroquois</i>
steamed along, yet night found her unsuccessful. When dusk came, the
lookouts were ordered from the masts, the engines were stopped, and the
<i>Iroquois</i> was allowed to drift before the wind, which had now
considerably abated. The boat rolled and wallowed in the sea, but the
waves were not now severe enough to be a menace.</p>

<p>“Do you think you’ll find her?” asked Henry, while he and the captain
were eating supper.</p>

<p>“If she’s afloat I think we’re quite likely to find her. She’ll drive
straight before this wind. But it may take us three or four days yet.”</p>

<p>“Three or four days!” cried Henry, in astonishment. “Why, I had no idea
a derelict could float so far or so fast.”</p>

<p>“You see we’re in the Gulf Stream, Henry,” said the captain, “and both
wind and tide will drive her. Why, the <i>Iroquois</i> once chased a derelict
in the Gulf Stream that floated two hundred and eighty-five miles in
four days. This one might go as far. And while we make a big total of
miles, we don’t advance so very far in one day along the course of the
derelict.”</p>

<p>It looked as though the captain’s prediction of a long search was to be
realized, for the second day’s run was as fruitless as the first had
been. Once more the cutter drifted with the wind during the hours of
darkness, yet all the time she was gaining on the derelict, for,
standing high above the water, she would drift twice as fast as a
low-lying hulk.</p>

<p>At noon the next day the <i>Iroquois</i> had reached the point marked B on
the diagram. Here the lookouts discovered three pine boards. They were
floating almost exactly in the line the captain had drawn as the
probable course of the derelict. Instead of standing on this leg of his
grid as usual, the captain ran on for only three or four miles further,
and then came about to starboard. This tack brought him once more across
the supposed line of the derelict’s path. Here some bits of wreckage
were seen. It now seemed certain that the wreck had come along the line
indicated in the captain’s diagram, and must, therefore, be straight to
leeward. A few moments later the matter was definitely settled, when one
of the lookouts spied a floating hulk exactly in the direction
indicated. The cutter was brought about and headed straight for the
derelict. In less than half an hour the <i>Iroquois</i> was rolling upon the
waves, only a few hundred yards from the derelict.</p>

<p>But how different this was in appearance from the craft Henry had been
expecting to see. He had looked for a boat with its masts snapped off,
riding low in the water, with the waves washing over its deck. Instead
of that there lay before them about half of the hulk of a boat, bottom
up. Evidently the craft had been broken in half by the storm. The after
part had no doubt sunk, but the forward end continued to float, upheld
by the air imprisoned within her. The broken midship section floated low
under the waves, while the bow projected well above the water. Her
bottom was dark and slimy, and Henry shuddered as he looked at the
monster, for monster she was, a floating monster, lying in wait for
other creatures of her kind. And Henry thanked fortune that the
<i>Iroquois</i> had not run upon this lurking death in the darkness of the
night and torn herself apart, to drop to the floor of the ocean, even as
half of this derelict had already done, and as the other half was so
soon to do.</p>

<p>For no sooner had the <i>Iroquois</i> lost headway than the gripes were
unfastened on one of the small boats, the falls loosened, and the boat
lowered level with the rail. Meantime, the necessary materials for
destroying the derelict had been assembled. These were now lifted aboard
the small boat and the crew leaped in after them. Then Lieutenant Hill,
who was to command, took his place in the stern. Oars were gotten ready,
and at a favorable opportunity the boat was dropped gently into the
waves. In a moment she was riding safely at a little distance from the
<i>Iroquois</i>, and her oarsmen were bending to their oars.</p>

<p>How astonished Henry was as he watched the little boat fight its way
over to the derelict. Now it went up, up, up, until it reached the very
crest of a wave, then it dropped into the trough-like depression just
ahead and was almost lost to sight, only to come shooting upward again
on the next billow. So it made its way to the derelict. Meantime the
entire crew of the <i>Iroquois</i> leaned over the rail, watching.</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the onlookers, the small boat turned shortly
after it reached the wreck and pulled straight back to the <i>Iroquois</i>
without making any attempt to destroy it. The captain awaited the return
of the boat by the leeward rail.</p>

<p>“What’s the difficulty, Mr. Hill?” he called, when the small boat came
within speaking distance.</p>

<p>“We need some storm oil and a drip-bag,” shouted the lieutenant through
cupped hands. “It’s so rough that we can’t get close to her.”</p>

<p>The desired materials were brought and the small boat returned toward
the derelict. Meantime, the oil had been poured from the can into the
drip-bag, which was merely a conical bag of tightly-woven duck stuffed
with oakum. When the boat had pulled some distance to windward of the
hulk, a sailor jabbed several holes in the drip-bag with a knife-point,
and the bag was hung out over the water on the end of an oar. But
apparently the effect was not all Mr. Hill hoped for, for presently the
boat pulled around to leeward of the hulk and the dripping process was
repeated.</p>

<p>“What are they doing?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“Oiling the water,” said the executive officer, who stood near him.
“That is to stop the waves from breaking.”</p>

<p>Henry had heard that oil would still the troubled waves, but it hardly
seemed credible that little drops of oil could produce the effect he now
witnessed, for slowly but surely the sea about the derelict grew calmer.
To be sure, the water still rose and fell, but no longer did the wave
crests break. Like a billowing sea of glass was the ocean, rather than a
storm-torn sheet of water.</p>

<p>Now the small boat came close to the old hulk. A length of strong wire,
with a mine attached, was fastened to the hulk, and the mine lowered so
that it hung just below the bottom of it. Then the small boat rowed off
to windward, paying out as it went the detonating wires attached to the
mine. Three hundred yards away the boat was stopped. The lieutenant
touched off his electric battery. There was a tremendous explosion. The
sea heaved upward like a waterspout, and great pieces of the shattered
bottom of the derelict were blown aloft, shooting up and up and up until
they were a thousand feet in air. Presently they came raining down
again, some of them dangerously close to the <i>Iroquois’</i> small boat.</p>

<p>When Henry looked at the sea again, the derelict had disappeared. But
several dangerously large pieces of the hulk still floated. Immediately
Lieutenant Hill began to herd these together. When they were all
collected, the sailors lashed them together, a second mine was secured
beneath them, and once more the small boat pulled away to the length of
the detonating wires. Again there was a terrific explosion, and this
time the shattered bits of wreckage shot even higher into the air than
they had gone before. When they had all dropped back into the sea again,
the small boat rowed back to where the derelict had been, but nothing
big enough to menace navigation now floated above the waves.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hill turned his boat toward the <i>Iroquois</i>. A few minutes
later the dripping craft once more hung on its davits, securely lashed
to its strongback. The men had returned to their stations, the propeller
was churning the salty sea, and the <i>Iroquois</i> was speeding back to her
anchorage off Staten Island, with her task accomplished, and the pathway
of the ocean freed of one more menace.</p>

<p>Truly, Henry thought, it was a great thing to belong to the Coast Guard.
If there was any way by which he could accomplish it, he meant to become
a wireless man on a Coast Guard cutter. His decision had been made. He
knew he would never be satisfied until he, too, wore a blue uniform with
red electric flashes and some red bars on his blue sleeve. But how he
was to accomplish his end was quite another matter. There was evidently
no place for him on the <i>Iroquois</i>, and probably every other cutter in
the service had likewise its full complement of wireless men.</p>

</div>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A CALL FOR HELP</span>
</h2>

<p>Yet Henry, having come to a decision, proceeded with characteristic
directness to try to accomplish his purpose. The minute he had an
opportunity to speak to the commander alone, Henry said to him, “Captain
Hardwick, I’ve decided that I should like to become a Coast Guard
wireless man. Ever since my old chum, Roy Mercer, became wireless man on
the <i>Lycoming</i>, I’ve thought that I should like to have a similar job.
Yet I wasn’t quite sure that I should like the sea. Now that I’ve seen
the ocean, I have come to a decision. Is there any way I can get a job
in the Coast Guard as a wireless man?”</p>

<p>“Just at present we have our full complement of wireless men aboard the
<i>Iroquois</i>,” replied Captain Hardwick, “so there is no opening on this
vessel. There might be on some other ship. But in any case, you would
have to take an initial examination at the hands of a ship’s chief radio
man. You might as well take an examination here and now. Mr. Sharp will
put you through your paces, if you like, and you will know whether you
are competent to fill the place you want. If you are not, Mr. Sharp
would be glad to coach you, so that you could become competent. So,
whether there is an immediate opening or not, this really looks like an
opportunity for you, doesn’t it? And if you prove to be competent, I can
recommend you to another commander.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, Captain Hardwick. I see that it <i>is</i> a real
opportunity. And if Mr. Sharp is willing to examine me, I’ll be only too
thankful to him and to you.”</p>

<p>The captain rose and rang his call-bell.</p>

<p>“Rollin,” he said, when his attendant appeared, “tell Mr. Sharp that I
would like to speak to him.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the chief electrician knocked and entered the cabin.
The commander said to him, “Our young friend here,” indicating Henry,
“has decided that he wants to become a Coast Guard radio man. I told him
we had no opening for him on the <i>Iroquois</i>, but that we would examine
him anyway and see whether he is qualified. I wish you would see what he
can do, Mr. Sharp. Test him out thoroughly, and if he is a little weak,
I would like it if you would coach him a bit. When will it be convenient
for you?”</p>

<p>“I go on my regular watch in half an hour, Captain, and we would then be
uninterrupted. I could give him a thorough examination.”</p>

<p>“Very good. That is the arrangement, then.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Henry joined the chief electrician in the wireless
shack. The latter first questioned Henry concerning the equipment and
the theory of wireless. He found that Henry had a good basic
understanding of these matters. The brand-new instruments that Henry had
not hitherto been acquainted with, he understood at once when their
operation was explained to him. In general knowledge and understanding
Henry was, the examiner found, fully the equal of even a first-class
radio man. When it came to operating the key, Henry showed that he was
very proficient. That the chief electrician already knew. Nevertheless
he examined Henry thoroughly. He made him flash out all the letters of
the alphabet. Then he gave him a message to send, and told Henry to get
it off at his best speed. Henry called the imaginary party to whom he
was signaling and then dashed off the message almost as fast as the
chief electrician could have done it himself. His sending was flawless.</p>

<p>“Now let me see how you receive,” ordered the chief operator.</p>

<p>Both men sat with phones strapped to their heads. Henry began to search
the air for messages, shifting from the very short wave-length at which
he was operating up through the longer wave-lengths. Suddenly he ceased
his shifting, and, seizing a pencil, wrote down this despatch:
“Hurricane warning displayed 10 <span style='font-size:smaller'>P. M.</span> in Louisiana, Alabama, extreme
northwest Florida coast. Storm now central about latitude twenty-seven
north, longitude ninety-two west. It has reached hurricane intensity and
is apparently moving northeastward toward the Louisiana coast which it
will reach late tonight or tomorrow morning. Dangerously shifting gales
indicated.”</p>

<p>When Henry had finished taking the message, he tore from the pad the
sheet on which he had written and passed it to his companion. The latter
also had been copying the message. “Absolutely correct,” he said. “I’ll
give you one hundred on that.”</p>

<p>“And what will you give me on my entire examination, providing, of
course, that the examination is ended?”</p>

<p>“It is. I can’t see that you lack anything as an operator. I’ll have to
take off at least one point for your unfamiliarity with the new
instruments. That would give you 99. I’d hate to give you such a grade,
though. That would be too good to be true. I’ll mark you 97.”</p>

<p>“But suppose I deserved the 99. Would that be fair?”</p>

<p>“Young man,” said the chief electrician, “I reckon there’s mighty few of
us can qualify as being so near perfect. You ought to be mighty well
pleased to get 97. The passing mark is 75, and mighty few ever get much
above 90.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am well enough pleased,” Henry went on. “But that wasn’t the
point. It’s a question of what I deserve.”</p>

<p>“I’m giving you all you deserve—maybe more than you deserve.”</p>

<p>“Then mark me down,” objected Henry. “If I deserve 99 I think I ought to
have it. And if I don’t deserve 97, I ought not to have 97. I want
what’s right. This examination is taken under somewhat unusual
circumstances. I realize that. And I don’t want anybody to think it
wasn’t perfectly on the level.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that. I’ll give you a grade that I think you are
justly entitled to, and I’ll stand back of that grade to the last ditch.
When we get right down to it, there’s more at stake than the matter of
your grade. There’s my ability and honesty as an examiner. I’m not
forgetting my own reputation in giving you your grade. That will be 97.
Now I must copy in my log the message you caught.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“Why, you know the wireless man has to keep a wireless log just the same
as the navigator has to keep a navigator’s log. I have to be able to
show what goes on in the wireless house.”</p>

<p>“Just as we had to keep a record at the Frankfort station, I suppose.
What do you put in your logbook?”</p>

<p>“Well, every day when we are not in port I have to send our position at
certain hours to the radio station in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. I have to
send all other messages. Records of these must be kept. All storm
warnings and naval-station broadcasts must be taken. I must record the
messages received, and, from time to time, something that one picks out
of the air should be entered, merely to show that the radio man was on
his job. So I’ll just enter that hurricane warning. It doesn’t concern
us, but if it did affect us, I’d have to take it to the captain at
once.”</p>

<p>“You said you had to send all messages,” replied Henry. “You didn’t mean
that you send every message yourself, did you?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I meant. I can’t take a chance on having anything
happen to this outfit. I’m responsible for it, and if it got burned out,
the result might be a court-martial, with possible dishonorable
dismissal and loss of citizenship. You see our power transformer steps
the current up to eight thousand volts. A green operator doesn’t
understand the rheostats, and would allow too great a voltage to pass
through the generator. That would burn out the transformer or puncture
the condensers or break down the insulation in the spark-gap, according
to which was the weakest. We usually carry spare condensers and spare
jackets for the spark-gap, but no spare transformer. It’s a mighty
serious thing to burn out a wireless set. If anything happened to the
ship, there would be no way to call help, and the entire crew might,
consequently, be lost.”</p>

<p>During the chief radio man’s entire watch of four hours, Henry sat with
him in the radio shack. After the examination was ended, Mr. Sharp
connected up with the loud speaker of the radio, and the two watchers
laid down their headphones. They could talk freely. The loud speaker
would tell them of every message in their wave-length that passed their
way. To Henry this was, indeed, a rare opportunity. Again and again he
went over every detail of the wireless apparatus, until he could have
reconstructed the intricate outfit alone, had it been taken to pieces.
And he asked the chief electrician countless questions as to wireless
practice. With the wide knowledge he already possessed, he was in a
position to learn much in a short time. When he left the wireless shack
at the end of the watch, Henry felt that he had added much to his
ability as a wireless man.</p>

<p>If Henry could have heard Mr. Sharp’s report to Captain Hardwick, he
would have been pleased, indeed. For the chief electrician went
immediately to the captain’s cabin when the watch was ended.</p>

<p>“Does he know anything about wireless?” asked the commander, when the
chief radio man told him the examination was over.</p>

<p>“He’s a dandy, Captain,” smiled the wireless man. “So far as the matter
of wireless comprehension and ability to receive and send are concerned,
he’s easily superior to my regular assistants, much superior. But what I
like about him is his spirit and his comprehension. He’s anything but a
dumb-bell. I think he’s fairly entitled to a grade of 97 on his
examination.”</p>

<p>The captain smiled. “I guess you are favoring him a bit,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, I am not. You see he has had an excellent training. He was a
substitute operator in the Frankfort government station for a time. They
employ only first-class men in such a station, you know.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to have such a favorable report of him. I’ve taken a great
fancy to the lad, and wish he could be one of your assistants.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said the chief electrician.</p>

<p>“You might coach him a little and help him get ready for his second
examination. He’ll be taking it somewhere sometime.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to do so, Captain.”</p>

<p>When Henry came to the cabin for the next meal, the captain said, “Mr.
Sharp tells me your work was sufficiently good to pass you. I am glad. I
wish there were a vacancy here to which I could appoint you. I hope you
will keep on studying and practicing so as to acquire real proficiency.
If you do, I shall be glad to do all I can to help you get a job.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to thank you, Captain Hardwick,” said Henry
gratefully. “What I can’t understand is why you should be willing to do
so much for a boy who is a perfect stranger to you.”</p>

<p>“Would you really like to know?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I would.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you. It is because of what I read in your face.”</p>

<p>“What can you read in my face?” cried Henry in amazement.</p>

<p>“A great deal that you don’t dream of. Perhaps you do not know that all
of us write our histories on our faces.”</p>

<p>“Our histories on our faces!” repeated Henry. “What do you mean,
Captain?”</p>

<p>“I mean just what I say. I know exactly the sort of boy you are, just as
well as though I had known you all your life. And I would know just as
truly if you were mean or cowardly or dishonest.”</p>

<p>Henry was too much astonished for words. The captain’s remark made him
very serious for a time. “Gee whiz!” he thought. “If what the captain
says is true, a fellow has to be mighty careful what he does. Why, just
think of all the wonderful things that Captain Hardwick has done for me,
and he says he did them because of what he read in my face. I can hardly
believe it. Yet there must be something in it, for there are those two
assistant radio men and I dislike the one and like the other, and it’s
nothing in the world that makes me feel that way except their faces.
Gee! I’m glad the captain didn’t dislike my face. And if what I do is
going to affect my face and so affect my fortune, you can bet I’ll be
mighty careful what I do.”</p>

<p>Imbued, from this time forward, with the idea of becoming a radio man,
Henry spent much of his time in the radio shack. His friendship for
young Belford grew rapidly, and the two spent many pleasant hours
together. They were about of an age and had much in common. Henry tried
to be friendly with young Black, too, but the latter did not seem to
welcome his advances. Nothing seemed to please him. He did not like his
life on the <i>Iroquois</i>. He said his job was a miserable one, and when
Henry asked why it was distasteful, he replied that being a radio man
wasn’t bad in itself if only a fellow had decent companions to work
with. Nobody, he said, could be expected to like his work if he had a
boss like the chief electrician.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you like the chief electrician?” Henry asked the lad.</p>

<p>“He’s a slave driver. He’s nothing but a crank,” and the lad swore
viciously.</p>

<p>“Why do you think he is a crank?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“He’s too particular,” and again he swore. “And he won’t let anybody
touch his blamed old key but himself. You might think he owned it.”</p>

<p>“But just think,” urged Henry. “This outfit is worth ten thousand
dollars. If it’s harmed, he is responsible for the damage.”</p>

<p>“Who’d hurt his old wireless? And, anyway, why should he care? It’s
Uncle Sam’s, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>Henry was shocked at the lad’s attitude. He wanted to tell him that if
Mr. Sharp considered his assistants fully competent to operate the
wireless, he would doubtless gladly let them do their full share of the
work. But he knew that would lead to a disagreeable argument, if not
indeed to an open quarrel, so he passed the matter off by saying, “I
suppose he has reasons we don’t know about.”</p>

<p>“Reasons,” sneered the operator. “Sure he has, and I know what they are.
He don’t want nobody but himself to get ahead. He wants to make me stay
a third-class man. He ain’t willing to let me use the instruments so I
can learn more about it. Oh! His reasons are plain enough. He’s got it
in for me.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been on the <i>Iroquois</i>?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“Six months.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose you have taken your examinations for second-class
operator.”</p>

<p>“Yes. And that old dumb-bell flunked me,” and again the lad swore
viciously.</p>

<p>But Henry had little time to ponder over the grievances of the radio
man, unreasonable though he believed them to be. Every minute was filled
with interest. Particularly was he pleased when a message came out of
the air for the <i>Iroquois</i>, ordering her to proceed to Boston to take
aboard certain stores at the Boston Navy Yard. Henry had never dreamed
of seeing Boston, and he was overjoyed at the prospect. It might give
him an opportunity to see Bunker Hill and other historic spots he had
read about.</p>

<p>The <i>Iroquois</i>, in her pursuit of the derelict, had run well up the New
England coast, and it was not much out of her way to touch at Boston.
The captain headed direct for that city, and Henry was looking forward
to seeing, within a few hours, the scene of the Boston tea party, when
another message came whining through the ether that made Henry for a
time forget all about Boston. For this new message Henry read in the
radio shack as young Black, who was on watch, copied it down. It read as
follows:</p>

<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“First mate nearly dead with fever.</div>
<div class='cbline'>Can you give medical assistance?</div>
<div class='cbline'>Heard you give your location. Our</div>
<div class='cbline'>position is forty-three north latitude,</div>
<div class='cbline'>sixty-five west longitude. Will stand</div>
<div class='cbline'>by for reply.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The message came from a Norwegian tramp steamer, the <i>Viking</i>. Henry
volunteered to take the message to the captain’s cabin. When the
commander had read the message, he drew a chart from a drawer of his
desk and picked up pencil and ruler.</p>

<p>“We ought to be about at forty-one north and sixty-four west,” he
muttered, marking the spot on his chart. “The tramp is here,” and he
made a second dot on his map. He drew an equilateral triangle on his map
and noted where the shoreward apex fell. “We won’t have to go a fathom
out of our way,” he said. Then he drew a radio telegraph blank from the
pigeonhole of his desk and wrote this message:</p>

<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“Proceed to sixty-seven west and</div>
<div class='cbline'>forty-two north and wait for the</div>
<div class='cbline'><i>Iroquois</i>. Will send surgeon aboard.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Henry returned to the radio shack with the message, the chief
electrician was there. “Would you like to send the message yourself?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Indeed I would,” said Henry.</p>

<p>“All right. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Henry sat down and flashed out the message as rapidly and surely as Mr.
Sharp would have done it himself.</p>

<p>“Enter that in the log,” said the chief to young Black.</p>

<p>The latter said nothing. Sullenly he picked up a pen and made the entry.
But if black looks could have killed anybody, both Henry and the chief
electrician would have dropped dead in their tracks. Before the young
radio man had finished writing, another message came crackling aboard:
“Will meet you sixty-seven west, forty-two north.”</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chVII' title='VII: A TRAMP OF THE SEAS'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A TRAMP OF THE SEAS</span>
</h2>

<p>Immediately Henry made his way to the A captain’s cabin again. He handed
a copy of the despatch to the commander.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Captain Hardwick. Glancing at the message, he muttered
his approval. Just then the chief engineer, whom the commander had
summoned, came into the cabin.</p>

<p>“Mr. Farley,” said the commander, “there’s a tramp a little farther up
the coast that just sent us a wireless for a doctor. Mate’s sick. We’ve
told her where to meet us. It will take several hours to reach her.
We’re making about twelve knots, aren’t we? Suppose you push her up to
top speed, fifteen knots. We can slow down again after the doctor has
seen the sick man.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.” And the chief engineer withdrew.</p>

<p>At once the captain went to the chart-room. Lieutenant Hill was on duty.
Together they figured out the new course and gave the direction to the
helmsman, who brought the ship about. Meantime the vibration of the ship
became more noticeable, and the grinding noise of her machinery grew
louder. She began to forge ahead faster and faster. Soon she was
throwing up a big bow wave and plunging through the seas at a fast pace.</p>

<p>Although the wind had abated and the seas were greatly lessened, the
<i>Iroquois</i> rolled more than she had rolled before, even when the wind
was at its worst. That was because the ship was now running almost in
the trough of the seas, whereas during the trip up the Gulf Stream both
wind and seas had been almost dead astern.</p>

<p>For a time Henry stood on the bridge, watching the clear and sparkling
sea. The quartermaster, Mr. Andrews, was also on watch, with the
lieutenant. Henry was much drawn to the quartermaster. He was a young
fellow not many years older than Henry himself. He had a fine fresh
face, and his eye was alight with ambition. His every movement suggested
strength and energy and determination. As the ship’s bell struck the
hour, he said: “I must look at the log. Would you like to come with me?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Henry, and the two slipped down the ladder to the deck and
skipped aft. Henry was getting his sea-legs fast.</p>

<p>Attached to the taffrail Henry saw the log the captain had described to
him. It appeared to be merely a long piece of heavy twine, trailing
behind the ship. But it was revolving fast. Henry looked over the rail
at the little dials that registered the revolutions.</p>

<p>“We’re going a bit faster,” said the quartermaster.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Henry. “The captain has put her under full speed.” And as
they returned to the bridge Henry asked, “How do you like life at sea?”</p>

<p>“First rate,” said the quartermaster. “There is always something to do,
the pay is good, and there are opportunities for advancement. The
captain is teaching me navigation, and some day I may be able to qualify
as an officer in the merchant marine. He’s a grand man, is the captain.”</p>

<p>“I believe it,” said Henry. “He sure has been fine to me.”</p>

<p>“He is to everybody who acts right. But, oh boy! You want to look out
for him if you don’t do what’s right.”</p>

<p>The ship rushed on. After a long time the quartermaster said, “Do you
know where we are to meet that tramp?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Henry. “At sixty-seven west, forty-two north.”</p>

<p>The two stepped into the chart-room and looked at the marks on the
chart. “We ought to sight her within a few minutes,” remarked the
quartermaster.</p>

<p>“May I go up in the crow’s-nest and look for her?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“Certainly, but be careful. If you aren’t used to climbing aloft, you
might get a nasty fall. Take these glasses, but be careful of them.”</p>

<p>Henry slipped the binoculars into the pocket of his coat, buttoned that
garment tight, and started up the forward mast. He soon found that the
quartermaster had told the truth. The rolling of the ship had seemed bad
enough on the deck, but up the mast it seemed a hundred times worse, and
the higher Henry went, the more violently the ship seemed to roll.</p>

<p>In a sense Henry was right. His position was now like that of an
inverted pendulum. When the ship rolled to one side, he was carried far
out by the mast, until at times his body hung over the open sea, beyond
the side of the ship. Then as the ship righted and rolled in the
opposite direction, Henry’s body shot through a wide arc and out over
the other side of the vessel, for the ship was rolling at times at an
angle of more than twenty degrees. At the first big roll Henry was
almost frightened. He felt himself going, going, going, and he was sure
the mast was going to give way and go on over with him, pitching him
into the briny deep. But just when he was sure the <i>Iroquois</i> must be
turning over, she righted herself with a snap like the lash of a whip.
Henry’s grasp was almost broken. He could hardly keep his feet on the
ladder-rungs, either. Tightening his grip, he mounted upward as fast as
he could, and presently found himself safe in the crow’s-nest. He sighed
with relief. As long as the mast stood, he knew he was safe here.</p>

<p>Intently now he swept the northern horizon with his glasses. Soon he
noticed a ship, but a moment’s study showed him it was heading out to
sea. Astern of her he soon saw another vessel. That one, too, was
outward bound. But when he brought his glasses farther around toward
land, he espied a steamer heading inward. He studied her intently. He
thought she was sailing in a long diagonal, as though to cross the
course of the <i>Iroquois</i>. For fifteen minutes he watched her. By this
time both ships had traveled some miles, and the strange ship was much
nearer. Her great bow wave showed she was being driven hard. There could
be no doubt as to her course being diagonal with their own. The men on
the bridge could now see her, too, so Henry pocketed his glasses and
carefully climbed down again.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the <i>Viking</i>,” said the quartermaster. Henry was
surprised to find how little could yet be seen of the ship from the
bridge.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we find out by wireless?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“Sure. We can ask Sparks to give ’em a call.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” said Henry, and he skipped down to the wireless shack. He
never overlooked any opportunity to see the wireless man work his key.</p>

<p>At Henry’s request, the wireless man gladly agreed to call the <i>Viking</i>.
He threw over his switch and pressed the key, and Henry sat fascinated
as he saw the bright flashes leap and crackle with the pressure of the
key.</p>

<p>“WXY—WXY—WXY—de—NTE,” called the operator.</p>

<p>Promptly came the response, “NTE—NTE—NTE—de—WXY—K.”</p>

<p>“Can you see anything of the <i>Iroquois</i>?” asked Mr. Sharp. “We see a big
freighter off our starboard bow, but don’t know if she is the <i>Viking</i>.
Please give us your bearing on <i>Iroquois</i>. Will stand by for reply.”</p>

<p>Presently came an answer. “Can see you plainly. Bearing is south
three-quarters east. You are only four or five miles distant.”</p>

<p>“That’s the <i>Viking</i> over there, without question,” said the wireless
man as he shut off his power. “Her bearing from us is exactly the
opposite of our bearing from her. That would make it north
three-quarters west. Take a look at the chart and you will see how it
is.”</p>

<p>Henry ran to the chart-room and laid a ruler along the course indicated.
It pointed straight from the position of the <i>Iroquois</i> in the direction
of the oncoming tramp. Then Henry stepped to the bridge.</p>

<p>Rapidly now the two steamships drew nearer, converging toward a common
point. As they approached closely enough for each to examine the other
well, the sailors on the <i>Iroquois</i> crowded to the forward rail, while a
row of sailors could be seen lining the side of the <i>Viking</i>. The latter
was a large, clumsy-looking cargo-boat, and was quite evidently not in
the best of condition. She needed paint badly. Great rusty blotches
marred her dark sides. Her rigging looked rickety. Huge derricks rose
fore and after, and the derrick-booms were lashed horizontally,
producing a peculiar appearance. At a little distance she looked as
though she were equipped with elevated plank-walks. Her decks were
littered with cargo. When the two vessels had come close to each other,
both were stopped, and preparations were made to put the doctor aboard
the <i>Viking</i>.</p>

<p>A small boat was lowered on the leeward side of the <i>Iroquois</i>, and the
doctor and the crew stepped into her as she dropped level with the rail.
The doctor carried his medicine case. Suddenly Henry turned to the
captain, who was watching operations. “Might I go along?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Do you want a passenger, Mr. Hill?” asked the captain, for the
lieutenant was in charge of the boat. “Mr. Harper here would like to
go.”</p>

<p>“Jump in,” was the lieutenant’s reply, and Henry scrambled over the rail
into the waiting boat.</p>

<p>In another moment the boat was far on its way to the <i>Viking</i>, the men
bending vigorously to their oars. How she did rise and fall. But Henry
was not now alarmed by the motion, as he might have been earlier. A
ladder was lowered from the <i>Viking</i> as the small boat drew near. The
little craft was laid skillfully alongside, the sailors made fast with
their boat-hooks, and the doctor scrambled up the ladder, followed by
the lieutenant and Henry. Some of the sailors also came aboard.</p>

<p>The captain welcomed the lieutenant and the doctor warmly, and then led
the way to the officers’ quarters. The officers were plainly foreign.
They were bearded and ruddy, with light hair, and with the strong,
honest countenances so typical of Scandinavians. Henry knew without
being told that they came from Norway or Sweden. They were decently
dressed in the customary uniforms of sea officers.</p>

<p>Curious to know how a merchantman’s cabin compared with that of the
<i>Iroquois</i>, Henry followed the doctor. He found the officers’ quarters
very comfortable, but not nearly so elaborate as those on the Coast
Guard cutter. The mate was in his bunk, and was quite evidently very
ill. He was pale and wasted and he tossed feebly on his mattress,
muttering unintelligibly in his native tongue. Plainly he was out of his
head. The room smelled close and foul, with that sour, offensive odor so
peculiar to sick rooms. It was more than Henry could stand, and he
retreated to the deck.</p>

<p>With interest he examined the big freighter. It was the first time he
had ever been aboard such a vessel. She was a ship of good length, built
for capacity rather than speed, and her lines were as ample as those of
a Dutch hausfrau. They made the boat appear clumsy. She was cut low
amidship, her forecastle and afterdecks being built at a higher level.
The long stretch of clear deck, unbroken by superstructure, made the
craft seem longer than she really was. Fore and aft rose the enormous
cargo-derricks, which had been so conspicuous from a distance. And Henry
was interested to see how the derrick-booms were lashed in their places.
The cargo hatches were mostly battened down.</p>

<p>But Henry had little interest in anything else, once he had a good look
at the crew, grouped along the forward rail. When he saw them, it seemed
as though he had somehow been magically transported of a sudden to a
strange and foreign land. Never had he seen such a queer-looking lot of
men as these sailors. There were Chinese, with their yellow,
sickly-looking skins and dark crowns and curious-shaped eyes: and
Lascars, swarthy and stolid and mysterious looking: and little,
black-eyed Japanese, with their straight, coarse black hair and
inscrutable faces. And the sounds—the grunts and curious guttural
mumblings—that arose among these Oriental sailors were as odd and
unintelligible as the men themselves appeared to be. Henry wondered how
white men could possibly bring themselves to live with such seemingly
uncongenial companions in such an isolated and lonely place as an
ocean-going steamer. Much as he thought he would like life at sea, he
was certain he would not like it if he had to live under such
conditions.</p>

<p>When Henry’s eye caught sight of the wireless antennæ, he decided at
once to visit the wireless man. Following the lead-in wire with his eye,
he located the wireless shack, and promptly knocked at the door. He was
both surprised and pleased when the door was thrown open and a cheery
voice said, in good English, though with a foreign accent: “Good-day,
sir. I am glad to see you. Won’t you come in?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Henry. “I will be glad to come in. I am interested in
wireless.”</p>

<p>“Are you an operator yourself?” asked the <i>Viking’s</i> wireless man.</p>

<p>“Not exactly. I was an operator at one of the United States stations for
a little while. I am trying to get a place as operator in the Coast
Guard. I’m taking a trip with the <i>Iroquois</i> now. It’s my first trip at
sea.”</p>

<p>“Then you can read and send readily.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to say ‘How do you do’ to the operator on the
<i>Iroquois</i>?”</p>

<p>“Be tickled to death,” said Henry.</p>

<p>“Very well. Do it,” said the operator.</p>

<p>Henry sat down at the <i>Viking’s</i> key and threw on the power.
“NTE—NTE—NTE—de—WXY,” he flashed. And, almost before he had taken his
finger from the key, there came crackling in his ear the reply:
“WXY—WXY—WXY—de—NTE—K.”</p>

<p>Even had he been a thousand miles away, Henry would not have needed to
inquire who was sending. There could be no mistaking the smooth, even,
rapid telegraphing of Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Sharp,” rapped out Henry. “This is Henry Harper. The
operator has been courteous enough to allow me to use his equipment. The
<i>Viking</i> is a very interesting boat.”</p>

<p>Henry almost said she was a mighty curious old tub, but he remembered in
time that his host could read all he was sending. He was about to add
more, when he saw the lieutenant and the doctor step on deck. So he said
good-bye, thanked the operator for his courtesy, and joined the little
group from the <i>Iroquois</i>.</p>

<p>The more he saw of the freighter, the more he was pleased with his own
little boat. The <i>Viking’s</i> wireless did not compare with the equipment
of the <i>Iroquois</i>, any more than the rest of the boat compared with the
cutter for comfort and looks. If there was anything lacking to make
Henry sure of the difference, he found it when the doctor went into the
forecastle, to treat a sick sailor.</p>

<p>Henry went, too, but he did not remain long. The frightful smell in the
crew’s quarters almost sickened him. Everything was dirty and foul and
disorderly. Henry knew that in the crew’s quarters on the <i>Iroquois</i>,
though there was not much room, and there was more or less odor from the
cook’s galley, at least everything was scrupulously neat and spotlessly
clean. All that he saw made Henry the more certain that he had chosen
wisely in planning to get into the Coast Guard service. And when he
stepped to the deck and found himself at close quarters with the crew,
he knew he had made no mistake. Some American sailors might be “tough,”
he thought, but they were a million times more desirable as shipmates
than these unintelligible Orientals.</p>

<p>Henry was glad enough when the doctor at last reappeared on the deck and
prepared to return to the cutter. Good-byes were said, the <i>Viking’s</i>
captain thanked the doctor and the lieutenant, Henry called farewell to
the wireless man, and in a minute or two the little party from the
cutter was bobbing up and down again on the waves, on the way to the
<i>Iroquois</i>. Then the small boat was hoisted, swung inboard, and made
fast. The ship’s propeller began to revolve, the water foamed at the
bow, and, swinging into her course once more, the <i>Iroquois</i> was soon
speeding toward Boston.</p>

</h2>

<p>It was already dusk and night was at hand when the <i>Iroquois</i> was ready
to head for Boston. Already those off duty had eaten. The captain,
however, still remained on deck. He waited to make sure the ship was on
her proper course, for the new ensign was the only commissioned officer
now on duty, and the captain hesitated to allow him to figure the course
alone. But the ensign did it with the captain looking on, and set the
course with perfect accuracy.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the captain. “We have something like two hundred miles
to go, and we stand on this course the entire distance. Tell the
helmsman to hold her northwest three-quarters west.”</p>

<p>The ensign delivered the message, and the captain heard the man at the
wheel respond: “Aye, aye, sir. Northwest three-quarters west.” Then the
commander headed for his supper.</p>

<p>Henry stood at the foot of the ladder, waiting for him. “Captain
Hardwick,” he said, “the quartermaster has asked me if I would take
supper with him. May I?”</p>

<p>“So you’re tired of the old skipper already, are you?” laughed the
captain.</p>

<p>Henry was a bit embarrassed. “No, indeed, I am not, Captain, but you
see, I—I——”</p>

<p>“Run along, lad, and enjoy yourself. The old skipper has eaten by
himself too long to be worried about one more meal <i>à la solitaire</i>.”
And he patted Henry gently on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Henry was more than glad to be allowed to eat with the quartermaster. He
liked him greatly, and, furthermore, the latter had offered to show him
the forward part of the ship. Excepting for his hurried trip to the
fireroom and back, when he had caught a glimpse of the interior of the
<i>Iroquois</i>, Henry had as yet been nowhere below deck except in the
captain’s cabin and in the wardroom. His visit to the <i>Viking</i> had made
him curious to see just how the sailors on the <i>Iroquois</i> did live,
anyway: and he knew he would see them in their true colors if he went
with the quartermaster. There wouldn’t be any standing at attention, as
might be the case if the captain was along. But before they could do any
sightseeing, the two young men had to eat.</p>

<p>As they climbed down the steps to the mess room forward, Henry said to
his companion: “I wonder why the captain prefers to live alone in his
cabin. Of course it’s all right to be alone when he wants to work or
read, but I should suppose he’d prefer to live with his officers.”</p>

<p>“The matter of preference doesn’t enter into it,” said the
quartermaster. “He has to live alone in his cabin. The service
regulations require it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any sense to that,” said Henry.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. But you would if you were a seaman. Rules like that are
necessary to preserve discipline. The captain must be the absolute and
unquestioned boss. His word is law on shipboard. That is necessary for
the safety of the ship. And everything is done to make his subordinates
understand that he is absolute. This matter of living apart emphasizes
all this.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Henry. “And I suppose the same reason holds for the
officers living in the wardroom.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“But what about the warrant officers? They have to be obeyed, too. Yet
they don’t seem to be singled out in this way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes they are. You know there are four messes on this boat—the
captain’s mess, at which you have been eating, the wardroom mess, the
warrant officers’ mess, and the general mess for the crew.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Henry. “But what do you do in a case like the present? It
must be an hour or more since mess gear was piped.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s always a second mess for those who are on duty at meal
time. We’ll not have any trouble about that.”</p>

<p>By this time the two had taken their seats at the general mess table in
the forward part of the ship. The crew had eaten and gone away, but a
few seamen who had been on duty were now seated at the long table. A
mess attendant brought Henry and the quartermaster food, and the two ate
heartily. As they ate, Henry talked with the seamen about him. At first
he didn’t know how to engage them in conversation, but when he mentioned
baseball, they responded readily enough. The world’s series was near at
hand, and Henry soon found that there are no keener baseball fans than
American sailors. In a little while he was on good terms with a number
of seamen.</p>

<p>When the meal was ended, they went direct to the fireroom, descending by
iron steps into the very bowels of the ship. The farther down they went,
the hotter it became, and Henry wondered how men could ever endure it to
work in such heat. In front of the furnaces the heat was simply
unbearable, and when the firemen threw open the furnace doors, Henry
backed as far away as he could. It seemed as though the awful rush of
heat would roast him. Yet the stokers stood directly before the open
doors and worked at the glowing fires. Henry was surprised to see that
they wore thick flannel shirts. Later he learned that without those
shirts they could hardly have endured the heat, either. The wool shut
out the terrible heat. These stokers were on duty only two hours or so
at a time. Even such short watches were exhausting. And when Henry and
his guide later came up from the fireroom, they noticed firemen, black
with coal dust, stretched out here and there in the passages, sleeping
soundly on the hard floors, where they had dropped when they came out of
the fireroom.</p>

<p>The great boilers and the huge engines interested Henry greatly. How
smoothly the pistons shot back and forth, how the various wheels turned
endlessly, how the great shaft revolved ceaselessly. Henry saw the
oilers passing from part to part of the engine-room, watching, oiling,
tightening or loosening nuts, wiping this or that with oily rags, always
alert, watching their engines as a mother watches her child. When Henry
thought of the grimy coal passers he had just seen, conveying the fuel
for the furnaces, and the men keeping the fires at red heat, and the
engineers watching the great machines that drove the ship, and the
sailors standing watch forward in the dark, and the helmsman at the
wheel, with his eye directed steadfastly at the compass, he saw how
necessary every part of the ship was to the other parts, and how
especially necessary it was that the man in charge be ever vigilant, and
that instant and unquestioning obedience be rendered to him. Henry began
to see why it was a good thing for the captain to live in state, alone.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that there must be quantities of explosives aboard a
ship like this cutter. Indeed, some of them had just been used, and
Henry knew how powerful they were. He wondered if these were also
watched. He put the question to the quartermaster.</p>

<p>“You can bet your life the explosives are watched. They are examined
every day. You know there’s a lot of guncotton among them, and if that
stuff deteriorates, it’s likely to make trouble.”</p>

<p>“But how can they tell if it does deteriorate?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s easy. There’s litmus paper packed in each jar of the stuff.
That will change color if the guncotton begins to go bad. Haven’t you
noticed that heavy, peculiar-shaped flash-light in the captain’s cabin?
That’s the light they use in examining the explosives in the magazine.”</p>

<p>“I should think it wouldn’t be safe to store explosives so near those
hot furnaces.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be. The magazine is in the very stern of the ship, right
under the captain’s cabin. You eat and sleep right over the explosives.”</p>

<p>Henry could almost feel his hair rise on end. “Jumping Jupiter!” he
exclaimed. “I do?”</p>

<p>The quartermaster laughed. “If the things in the magazine ever let go,”
he said, “I guess the folks in the cabin wouldn’t be much worse off than
the rest of us. The explosives there would tear this old boat all to
pieces.” After what Henry had seen so lately, he could believe it.</p>

<p>The two continued their tour of investigation. Henry saw the little
office of the chief engineer, and spoke to Mr. Farley, who was at work
therein. He saw the cook’s galley, with its enormous range, and the
place for stores, where food is kept. He saw, too, the compartments
farther forward where paints were stored. It amazed him to find what
great quantities of paints and oils and varnishes were needed for such a
small ship. And Henry remembered, too, that at the time he first came
aboard sailors were working on slings over the side, scrubbing the hull
with swabs. No wonder she always looked so spick and span. It would have
been a good thing, Henry thought, if the <i>Viking</i> had some of these
paints, and her crew could touch up and clean her sides.</p>

<p>Before the two came up on deck, the quartermaster also showed Henry the
place forward where ropes, chains, cables, anchors, and similar gear
were kept. Such hawsers Henry had never seen before.</p>

<p>“How big are they, anyway?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Those are twelve-inch hawsers,” said the quartermaster. “The captain
thinks there’s nothing like a twelve-inch hawser for towing disabled
ships, unless it’s those heavy wire cables. You just can’t break them.
It’s very difficult to get them aboard of another ship in a heavy sea,
though. They haven’t the buoyancy of manila hawsers.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Henry. “But why do you call those manila hawsers
twelve-inch hawsers? They look to me only about four inches in diameter.
Maybe they are a bit more. But they aren’t anything like twelve inches.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the circumference and not the diameter of a hawser we reckon
by. You are right in thinking that hawser is nearly four inches in
diameter. It’s also about twelve inches in circumference.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Henry. “The circumference of a circle is always a
little more than three times the diameter.”</p>

<p>As they made their way back from the bow, where the hawsers were stored,
the quartermaster pointed out to Henry the hammock-hooks overhead, and
showed him some of the hammocks rolled and stowed away. Already one or
two men were asleep in theirs, swinging gently with the motion of the
ship.</p>

<p>“How in the mischief did they ever get up there?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“Pulled themselves up with their arms,” smiled the quartermaster. “If
ever you become a sailor, don’t let them kid you into looking for the
hammock-ladder. That’s a favorite trick played on apprentice seamen.
Sometimes a kid keeps hunting for a hammock-ladder for an hour or more.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for putting me wise,” said Henry. “I hope to go to sea some day,
and I reckon I’ll be the worst greenhorn that ever was.”</p>

<p>They started to go on deck. “There’s one thing I don’t understand,” said
Henry. “Why are those men going to bed so early? Why, it’s only a little
while after supper.”</p>

<p>“They have to do duty in the graveyard watch.”</p>

<p>“The graveyard watch? What is that, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know about the watches on shipboard?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you. You can see for yourself that men must be on duty
constantly in all parts of the ship. So the day is divided into little
stretches that we call watches. From noon to four o’clock is the
afternoon watch; four to six <span style='font-size:smaller'>P. M.</span> is the first day watch, and six to
eight is the second day watch. The evening watch is from eight to twelve
midnight. That’s a favorite watch, as it means very little loss of
sleep. The hard watch is from midnight to four <span style='font-size:smaller'>A. M.</span> That is the
mid-watch, but we call it the graveyard watch. The watch from four to
eight <span style='font-size:smaller'>A. M.</span> is the morning watch, and sometimes it is also called the
navigator’s watch. That isn’t a bad watch, either. The other watch is
from eight o’clock to noon, and is called the eight-to-twelve watch.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Henry. “There certainly is a lot to learn about a boat,
isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” said the quartermaster. “I suppose nobody ever learns
all there is to know about sailing a ship.”</p>

<p>By this time the two friends had reached the deck. At first Henry could
see nothing in the thick darkness. Then, as he became accustomed to the
night, he could make out all the features that had now become so
familiar to him. Also, he saw some things that were not familiar to him.
Little dark objects were moving about on the deck. At first Henry was
not sure that he saw aright, but when he was certain that something
really was moving, he said to his companion, “What is it that we see on
the deck?”</p>

<p>“Birds,” said the quartermaster. “Wait until I get a flash-light. We’ll
gather them up and take them to the captain. He’s mighty fond of them.”</p>

<p>He disappeared in the darkness and presently returned with his
flash-light. Together the two searched the deck from bow to stern. Many
little birds lay cold and stiff. They had evidently flown into something
and killed themselves. Regretfully, the searchers threw their bodies
into the sea. The living birds seemed to be unharmed, and suffered
themselves to be picked up without protest. Seven were found, and,
carrying these, the two descended to the captain’s cabin and knocked at
the door.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the commander, as they entered. “Some more pets for
me, eh? Thank you, Quartermaster.”</p>

<p>The captain placed the little birds in the deep embrasures of the
air-ports. Then he got saucers of water and some crumbs for them, but
they would not eat.</p>

<p>“Utterly exhausted, I suppose,” said the captain. “It’s strange that
such tiny creatures will venture so far away from land.”</p>

<p>Henry returned to the deck with the quartermaster. He spent a few
minutes in the wireless shack, then went on the bridge. But he had been
up a long time and on the go every minute of the day. Soon he was
nodding. Presently he said good-night to the men on watch, and in a few
moments was sound asleep in his bunk, while the ship stood steadily on
her course toward Boston Light.</p>

</h2>

<p>As usual, Henry found that the captain was up and about when he himself
awoke. As he hustled into his clothes he felt ashamed to seem to be such
a laggard. He found, however, that he wasn’t so late as he had thought.
In fact, it was still early, but the captain was such a tireless worker
that one would indeed have had to get up early to be ahead of him. As
usual, he was at his desk. He rose as Henry entered the cabin. In his
hand was a red-bordered Coast Guard radio telegraph blank.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” said the captain. “How are you this morning?”</p>

<p>“Just the very best,” said Henry. “I hope that I am not too late. I
wanted to be up before we reached the harbor. Are we anywhere near
Boston?”</p>

<p>“You’re just in time. We’re off Boston Light now. I am just going to
send this message to the Commandant of the Navy Yard.”</p>

<p>The commander reached for his call-bell, but Henry held out his hand.
“Let me take it,” he offered.</p>

<p>The captain handed him the message. Henry folded the sheet, writing
innermost. The commander smiled approval. “You may read it,” he said.</p>

<p>Henry opened the blank. It was addressed to the Commandant of the Boston
Navy Yard and read: “Request permission to land at Navy Yard to obtain
supplies from the <i>Oneida</i>. C. Hardwick, Commander, <i>Iroquois</i>.”</p>

<p>“Do you have to get permission to enter the Navy Yard?” exclaimed Henry.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, whether you come by land or by sea.”</p>

<p>Henry carried the message to the radio shack, and Mr. Sharp got it off
at once. Then he went to the bridge and bade the men on watch
good-morning, but he had little inclination for talk. The wonderful
scene that presented itself ahead fascinated him.</p>

<p>Already they had passed Boston Light, and the <i>Iroquois</i> was heading
directly for a low-lying island that lay in the water like a huge,
gray-brown button. It was George’s Island, and the queer-looking,
mound-like eminence on it was Fort Warren. Henry learned that a moment
later when he stepped into the chart-room and studied the map. He wanted
to know exactly what he was seeing.</p>

<p>Close beside George’s Island lay Lovell’s Island, a big, hulking, rocky
bit of land that reached some little elevation. There was also a third
island, Gallup Island. And these three, like nuts between the extended
jaws of a pair of pincers, lay between the long, tapering ends of the
mainland that thrust out into the sea for miles. Behind these pincers
was a great bay, practically land-locked, and filled with islands. Its
coast line was cut and gashed with points and inlets. Everywhere the
combers were crashing on the beaches and shining white in the morning
sun. And on these islands and points, and along the shore, stood
innumerable cottages, which Henry judged must be summer residences.</p>

<p>As the <i>Iroquois</i> approached George’s Island the ship was headed
northwest one-half north. Now she steamed between Gallup and Lovell’s
Islands, and Henry examined with interest the quarantine station on the
former. Past Deer Island they went, with its huge and gloomy-looking
prison and great stone walls, and past Long Island and Spectacle Island,
which got its name because it is shaped not unlike a huge pair of
nose-glasses. And, turning as the channel twisted, the <i>Iroquois</i> worked
her way into the ever-narrowing mouth of the harbor, with the captain
now on the bridge, conning the ship through the tortuous passage.
Thompson’s Island was passed, and Governor’s Island, with Fort Winthrop,
and now the narrow harbor was close at hand. Meantime the radio man had
handed to the captain the answer to the latter’s wireless message,
directing him where to dock the <i>Iroquois</i>.</p>

<p>How interesting it was to Henry. To be sure, the scene lacked the
picturesqueness of the New York Harbor, with its unique sky line and its
Liberty Statue, yet it was wonderfully fascinating. High before them
towered two shafts. One was almost exactly like the Washington Monument,
which was entirely familiar to Henry even though he had never seen it.
He rightly guessed that this must be Bunker Hill Monument, and he was
glad that it was so near at hand. If he had opportunity, he meant to
visit it. The other tower was just as evidently a building. It reminded
Henry of the Metropolitan Tower in New York. The captain told him it was
the Boston Custom House. The remainder of the city looked much like any
other city. It was a mass of buildings, some big and some little,
crowded together so that one could hardly be distinguished from another.
In the docks lay vessels—goodly steamships and some many-masted
schooners; and of course there were tugs and smaller craft. But the
harbor life was quiet indeed compared with the bustle in the waters of
New York Bay. Nevertheless, it interested Henry deeply.</p>

<p>When the <i>Iroquois</i> at last lay snug in her dock in the Boston Navy
Yard, Henry was almost spellbound. Never had he dreamed of seeing such a
collection of vessels. Immediately across the pier from the <i>Iroquois</i>
he saw a ship standing high in air, with her keel not only out of water,
but almost at the level of the pier itself. Henry had never seen
anything like this before, and his astonishment was hardly lessened when
the captain told him that this was the marine railway on which ships
were hauled out of water, and that the vessel on the railway was the
Coast Guard cutter, <i>Oneida</i>. Her bottom was being scraped and painted,
and she was getting some new rivets in her plates.</p>

<p>But if Henry was astonished to see a ship high up in the air, he was
hardly less amazed to see another far down in the bowels of the earth,
for on the other side of the <i>Iroquois</i>, at no great distance, a little
lean, gray boat, was propped upright in the centre of a great hole that
had been dug in the earth. She was deep down. Henry judged her keel must
be a full thirty feet below the level of the surrounding earth. There
was no water in the hole, and workmen were busy all about the little
ship. As Henry soon discovered, this boat was in one of the Navy Yard
dry docks. He asked permission to look around, and the captain told him
to go where he liked, but cautioned him not to take too great liberties.</p>

<p>Henry stepped ashore and ran over to the dry dock. He was more amazed
than ever when he stood on the edge of it and looked down into it. It
was, indeed, a great hole in the ground—an excavation hundreds of feet
long and many yards wide. The sides were made of massive masonry, built
up like steps, of huge blocks of granite. The dry dock was as deep as a
tall house is high. In shape it was long, and would have been
rectangular had its inner end been square instead of rounding. The other
end, the square end, was what interested Henry, for when he came to
examine it, he found it was nothing but a water-gate. It was a great
steel structure, tremendously braced to make it strong, though at first
glimpse it seemed much like the rest of the wall. This steel end or gate
held the water out, for, of course, the dry dock opened into the harbor.
It was so made that water could pour through open ports, filling the
dock. Then the gate itself could be swung outward to one side, so that a
ship could enter the dock, and when the gate was once more swung in
place and the openings closed, pumps were put at work and all the water
pumped out, leaving the ship propped up securely on keel blocks. Thus
the workmen could work at every part of the ship at the same time.</p>

<p>And they were indeed working at every part of this ship at once, for
Henry now saw with even greater astonishment that the ship had been cut
in two. The bow, which had been sheared off in a collision, and the
after part of the boat were blocked in position, and these two parts
were now being reunited. The vessel was a torpedo boat and had been in
collision with a larger craft.</p>

<p>Henry was glad to see her, because he had never before seen a torpedo
boat close at hand. She was long, low, rakish, and built much like a
knife. Indeed, she had to be long and thin to attain the tremendous
speed at which these boats are sometimes driven, for they travel as fast
as express trains.</p>

<p>When he had satisfied his curiosity, Henry made a more general survey of
his surroundings. He noticed the great coal bunkers, where naval vessels
coaled. Little cars were traveling up an inclined railway, like a
procession of elephants, and dropping loads of coal in the elevated
bunkers, whence it could be shot downward to ships lying alongside. He
saw great numbers of huge anchors and cables and chains, and other
ship’s gear, lying on a pier. And there were several huge barges
floating in a dock, each containing as many naval launches as its deck
space would hold. Still other barges were laden with lumber and iron and
similar stores. There were great cranes afloat and ashore.</p>

<p>Near by, too, an eagle boat lay in a dock. Henry was glad to see it. He
had read about these submarine chasers during the war, but had never
seen one close at hand. This vessel was something more than one hundred
feet long, very narrow, low-lying, with some guns mounted on the low
deck, and her superstructure amidships. Her wireless antennæ and her
guns both held Henry’s attention. The longer he looked at her, the more
he wondered that she could withstand the sea. He knew something about
waves now, and he was sure that in a rough sea they would sweep across
the decks of this little craft again and again. At once he gained a
higher opinion of the hardy men who sailed these craft, in fair weather
and foul, and guarded the shipping lanes during the war.</p>

<p>When Henry had seen all he could see from the immediate neighborhood of
the <i>Iroquois</i>’ pier, he started to walk along the water-front. Almost
the first thing he came upon was a submarine. He was immensely pleased
to see one of these ships so close at hand. The tide was low, and the
little craft sat in her dock as snug as a duck in the reeds. Like the
torpedo boat and the eagle boat, the submarine was painted gray. She was
some hundreds of feet long, and made Henry think of a huge log afloat.
Her rounded sides rose only a few feet above the water. Amidships was
the conning tower, with its periscope. There were short masts for
wireless antennæ. The very top of the hull was flattened, so that the
crew could walk on it. Along the sides of this narrow deck were short
uprights with eyelets at their tops, which a life-line pierced, and this
line was the only rail the sailors had to keep them from falling into
the sea. Perhaps it was the big guns fastened to the deck that most
interested Henry. There was no way to protect them from the sea, and
when the ship was running submerged, he saw that these guns would stand
right up in the water. The horizontal rudders, by means of which the
ship was enabled to dive under the waves, were also interesting. They
were pivoted, so that, when not in use, they folded back into
depressions in the hull of the ship, just as a fish’s fins are sometimes
folded close against its body.</p>

<p>When Henry walked to the next piers he was thrilled, indeed, for there
lay two of our great fighting ships, the battleships <i>Utah</i> and
<i>Delaware</i>. What ponderous, grim, menacing hulks they were. How high
their decks were. How their superstructures towered aloft. How
threatening their turreted guns appeared. And what curious structures
the basketwork masts were. It seemed to Henry as though each of these
ships must contain a whole village of people, for he could see sailors
by the hundreds on board. Some were washing the ships’ sides, some were
at work on the decks, some were up in the superstructures. Wherever he
looked, he seemed to see men. And it was just like the dismissal of
church or school when a party of bluejackets came ashore on leave. They
poured down the gangplanks in masses, and went jauntily off toward the
gate for their holiday.</p>

<p>There were other ships, too. One was evidently a new vessel. It was
fiery red in its first coat of paint, and had peculiar lines, different
from those of any ship Henry had yet seen. The superstructure appeared
to be but one story high and to extend nearly the length of the vessel.
It was perfectly level, with no railings about it. Henry was so
astonished at the unusual appearance of the craft that he stepped up to
a group of workmen and asked what the ship was.</p>

<p>“That’s the <i>Whitney</i>,” said one of the men. “She was just launched a
few days ago. She’s a submarine tender.”</p>

<p>“What a queer top she has,” remarked Henry.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the workmen. “She was designed for an aëroplane carrier,
but they changed her into a submarine tender.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” responded Henry. “I suppose that explains the long, flat
top of her superstructure. That’s where the aëroplanes were to alight at
sea.”</p>

<p>Henry thanked his informant and hurried on. He saw the great collier
<i>Neptune</i>, and an oil carrier, the <i>Arethusa</i>, and the scout cruiser
<i>Chester</i>. The latter two lay side by side, and it made Henry actually
laugh to see the difference in their build. The swift scout cruiser was
lean and high, the oil carrier lower and fat, with sides that actually
bulged. The two ships were as different in appearance as a lean
greyhound and a fat collie.</p>

<p>But of all the craft in the Navy Yard none so fascinated Henry as the
old battleship Constitution. For there, close beside these modern ships
of war, lay old <i>Ironsides</i>, the frigate of forty battles, in which she
never knew defeat, the oldest and most famous vessel in the United
States Navy. There she lay, almost as old as the nation itself, for she
was built in 1797, and she was yet sound.</p>

<p>Thrilled by the sight, Henry stood on the pier beside her and examined
her every rope and spar. Her hull was one of those blocky, bulky,
upstanding structures typical of the long ago. High above the water
line, at intervals of a few feet, open ports reached from stem to stern,
and from each open port projected the grim and threatening muzzle of a
cannon. Her three masts were the most enormous spars Henry had ever
seen. Scores of feet they towered aloft, for mast stood upon mast, the
topmast being surmounted with still a third mast, until there was a most
bewildering array of shrouds and rigging. And such rigging! Often enough
had Henry seen the rigging of modern sailing ships. He knew well enough
what these rope ladders that lead to the crosstrees look like in modern
boats. But here, instead of the customary three stays on a side, were
stays after stays, with their crosspieces, so that many men at a time
could swarm up and down the rigging, and out on those enormous spars to
furl the sails, for the ship was a square rigger. And at the crosstrees
were great platforms where a dozen men could stand. Henry saw right away
the reason for these platforms. Sailors could stand here after furling
the sails. Sharpshooters could be stationed here, where they could see
over the smoke cloud, to pick off officers and men on opposing vessels,
for in those days vessels fought side by side, and even sought to
grapple each other so that crews could fight hand to hand. The old
ship’s bowsprit, too, was of unbelievable dimensions, extending yards
and yards beyond the bow and reaching an incredible elevation.</p>

<p>Henry saw that visitors were permitted on board, and he walked up the
gangplank. The deck of the <i>Constitution</i> was not unlike the deck of any
other sailing ship. But the gun deck, below, was fascinating. It was a
great bare section of the ship, whence projected the gun muzzles, and in
it was nothing but an ancient stove amidships, for heating cannon balls
red hot, and the rows of cannon on either side. Henry was amazed at the
number of these guns. A placard told him that the ship originally
carried forty-four. These were bulky, chunky affairs, mounted on heavy
wooden carriages, with small wheels beneath, and great hawsers and
tackles holding them in place. There were no breechloaders in the days
when the <i>Constitution</i> fought. Then each gun had to be run through its
port and swabbed out and loaded through the muzzle, and then it was run
out again with the tackle, blocked in place, and fired.</p>

<p>Henry could have spent hours examining the old craft, but he did not
know how long the <i>Iroquois</i> would lie in the Navy Yard, and he wanted
to see all he could while he was in Boston. So he reluctantly took a
last look at this famous old frigate, and made his way rapidly back to
the <i>Iroquois</i>. On the way he took note of the huge shops, some of them
covering as much ground as a city block, the great traveling cranes, the
shifting engines, and all the other vast equipment in the Navy Yard. It
was like a city in itself, and it made Henry proud to think that he was
an American.</p>

<p>Captain Hardwick informed Henry that there was some delay about the
stores, and that it would require several hours at least to transship
them. The <i>Iroquois</i> could not leave before late afternoon, and might
not get away before the next day. He secured a pass for Henry and told
him to look at Boston to his heart’s content, but to be sure not to get
lost.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that it is hard to get around in Boston,” agreed Henry.</p>

<p>“You’ll get lost, sure,” laughed the captain. “Everybody does.”</p>

<p>“Where could I get a map?” inquired Henry. “I wouldn’t get lost with a
map.”</p>

<p>“You may have mine,” said the commander. And he got for Henry a fine
little book of maps that folded between stiff covers. One of these maps
was of Boston.</p>

<p>On his way to the gate Henry noticed numerous buildings, like the
commissary stores. And there was a long row of houses, evidently for the
use of officers attached to the Navy Yard, with the commandant’s house
standing conspicuously near by. The row of houses looked out on a small
park, with a band stand in it, and Henry thought it must be very
delightful to be in the park on summer evenings and listen to the marine
bands.</p>

<p>Once outside the gate, Henry found it was no trick at all to reach
Bunker Hill Monument. That was just around the corner, as it were, up on
a bit of high ground. A few minutes’ walk brought Henry to it. He found
that the monument stood at the very apex of a considerable mound, that
was the size of a city block or two, and was laid out very pleasingly
with lawns and walks. Attractive residences faced the monument on all
four sides of the square. Henry found a policeman patrolling the
grounds, and the man seemed very willing to answer questions. He showed
Henry where the American fortifications lay, and where the British
troops swarmed the hill. A stone memorial marked one corner of the
redoubt. The monument itself, which was something more than two hundred
feet high, was exactly like the Washington Monument, Henry learned, for
the guide told him that the Washington Monument had been modeled after
it.</p>

<p>With interest Henry saw where the British troops had formed at the foot
of Breed’s Hill and marched up to the redoubt, only to be hurled back
twice by the unbearably deadly fire of the American marksmen. To be
sure, the land was now covered with solid blocks of buildings, but Henry
tried to picture to himself the field as it was in 1775, with long,
waving grass and a straggling stone wall behind which some of the
American troops took position.</p>

<p>His heart was filled with emotion as he left this spot, sacred to
liberty, and made his way down the hill again. His map showed him that
he was not far from Faneuil Hall. He wanted to see that old building
almost as much as he had wanted to see Bunker Hill. He found his way to
it, and was much interested in the curious old structure.</p>

<p>The great market house filled an entire small block, for, from its
birth, Faneuil Hall had been primarily a market. Henry walked completely
around it. Dozens of market dealers in dozens of stalls offered all
sorts of green foodstuffs for sale. Their wares were temptingly
displayed along the sidewalk. Celery, onions, apples, potatoes, and all
the various vegetables and green foods that we commonly eat were here to
be found. When he entered the market house itself, he found it divided
into two parts, through each of which went a long, central aisle, with
stalls on each side. Meats and poultry were to be had here. It made
Henry hungry to see the countless cuts of beef and veal and mutton.</p>

<p>A wide stairway led from the sidewalk at one end of the building up to
the second floor. Henry entered and went up the steep steps. He soon
found himself in a roomy and convenient auditorium, encircled by an
elevated gallery. The place was interesting, not only because of its
historic associations, but also because of its beautiful old woodwork
and mouldings and decorations.</p>

<p>The third floor Henry found to be the quarters of one of the Boston
troops. The huge floor was cleared, so that it could be used for
drilling or for dancing. Around the walls were hung the likenesses of
all the men who had been captains in this organization, and there were
pictures of the famous battles in which these troops had fought.</p>

<p>There was so much to see that Henry found he could never get over it
all, so he decided that he would see the famous old North Church, in the
belfry of which the lanterns were hung to notify Paul Revere which way
the British would journey to Lexington on that famous night in ’75. Near
by was the very house in which Paul Revere lived. So Henry, following
his map closely, hastened through a most bewildering labyrinth of
streets, and soon found himself in a region that was, to all
appearances, a part of Italy. The narrow, crooked streets were filled
with Italian children. In doorways sat shawled Italian women gossiping
and sewing. Italian shops lined the way. It was interesting and novel to
Henry. He had never before been in an Italian section of an American
city. But he had little time to look about. He hurried on until he came
to a little house so unlike any other building in the block that he did
not need his guidebook to tell him it was the home of Paul Revere. It
was a curious brown house, with tiny diamond-shaped panes in the little
leaded windows. The roof was low, and the second story seemed to be
hardly more than half a story in height. Henry saw that he could gain
admission by the payment of a small fee, but he thought he scarcely had
time to examine the house.</p>

<p>So he went on around a corner or two, and presently he found himself
standing before the old North Church. It was still a sightly structure,
with its shapely spire rising above its plain brick walls. An iron fence
rose in front of it. On the wall was a bronze tablet calling attention
to the fact that here were hung the lanterns that guided Paul Revere.</p>

<p>When Henry had examined the old church from every possible angle, he
turned away and headed for the <i>Iroquois</i>. At least, he turned away from
the church. Such curious rambling streets he had never seen. He knew
well enough that he would have been hopelessly lost without the
captain’s map. And even with that in his hand he was sometimes bothered
to know which way to go, so poorly were the streets marked. Many were
the new and interesting things he saw on his way back to the Navy Yard.
“I’m surely coming back to Boston again some time,” he thought. “It is a
wonderfully interesting place.” And then the idea occurred to him that
if he succeeded in becoming a Coast Guard man, it might be possible for
him to visit not only Boston, but also many other American cities. He
was more determined than ever that he would persist in his effort until
he won the place he wanted. Then, too, he could be of some real service
to this commander he loved, for Henry had become very loyal to Captain
Hardwick. The time when he could be of service to the commander of the
<i>Iroquois</i> was a great deal nearer than Henry dreamed. Perhaps it was as
well he did not realize that, or understand the trying experiences that
lay so close before him.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER X</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A SHIP IN DISTRESS</span>
</h2>

<p>Had Henry but known it, there was no immediate necessity for his return
to the <i>Iroquois</i>. Indeed, the Coast Guard cutter not only was unable to
sail that day, but she did not cast off her hawsers until afternoon the
day following. Although Henry thus had an unexpected half day in Boston,
he saw no more of the city than he had seen on the preceding day, for
when he awoke rain was pouring down, a vicious east wind was blowing,
and the elements were as nasty as they well could be.</p>

<p>Even a complete suit of rubber would hardly have kept one dry very long
in the slashing, blustering blasts that came howling through the Navy
Yard. The rain drove in horizontal sheets. It whipped around corners and
under doorways and awnings. It roared across open decks. It beat against
the air-ports. With ever-increasing force the gusts came tearing in from
the sea. Trees bent far over and groaned before their onslaught. Flags
whipped themselves to ribbons. Halyards beat a very devil’s tattoo
against their masts, and on the <i>Iroquois</i> the cordage fairly shrieked
in wild, wailing notes that made Henry almost shudder.</p>

<p>He was glad enough that the <i>Iroquois</i> had been unable to get away.
Never had the captain’s cabin seemed half so comfortable and attractive.
He told himself that he would be glad enough to spend the time there,
reading some of the interesting books from the captain’s bookshelf,
while waiting for the storm to subside.</p>

<p>Yet the movement of stores went forward without interruption. Sailors,
cased from head to foot in sou’westers, oilskins, and rubber boots,
worked without ceasing in the downpour to finish the transshipment.
Henry could hear them clumping about the deck in their clumsy footgear.
On the pier trucks rattled and banged. Boxes were wheeled aboard and
dumped on the deck. Men swore and slipped in the wet. Machinery rattled.</p>

<p>While Henry and his host were eating their luncheon, the noises suddenly
ceased. There were a few shouted orders, indistinguishable in the roar
of the storm, then some banging noises as hatches were closed and
battened down, and other openings made fast. Soon all was quiet. When
the luncheon was ended, Henry went up the companionway and peeped out.
Things had been made tight. Awnings had been removed. Everything was
lashed fast. The decks were bare. The <i>Iroquois</i> was stripped for
action.</p>

<p>Henry could hardly believe that Captain Hardwick would leave port in
such a storm. He knew that storm warnings must be showing all along the
New England coast, and perhaps the entire Atlantic seaboard, but before
he could return to the cabin and ask the captain if he intended to put
to sea, he saw the chief electrician running aft along the slippery
deck. Henry threw open the door for him, and the radio man dodged in out
of the blinding rain. He had a message for the captain.</p>

<p>Henry descended to the cabin with the electrician. Captain Hardwick took
the telegraph blank from Mr. Sharp and studied it a moment.</p>

<p>“No orders?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said the electrician.</p>

<p>The captain sat down at his desk, drew a red-bordered telegraph blank
from a pigeonhole, and wrote. “Send that,” he directed.</p>

<p>The radio man struggled out into the storm. The captain rose and touched
his call-bell.</p>

<p>“Rollin,” he said, when his attendant appeared, “ask Mr. Farley to come
to me at once.”</p>

<p>The commander picked up the telegram and handed it to Henry. “You’ll
have a chance to see something today, Henry,” he said.</p>

<p>Henry looked at the message in his hands. It was a cry of distress, an
SOS message the radio man had picked out of the air:</p>

<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“Steamer <i>Capitol City</i> ashore east</div>
<div class='cbline'>coast Cape Cod forty-two north, seventy</div>
<div class='cbline'>west. Pounding badly. Need immediate</div>
<div class='cbline'>assistance.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The chief engineer entered the cabin. “Start your engines at once, Mr.
Farley. We just caught a distress call. Steamer ashore on the east coast
of Cape Cod. See that everything is ready for a hard run.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” and the chief engineer hurried forward.</p>

<p>Soon the ship began to vibrate. The rumbling noise of the machinery
arose. Yet the <i>Iroquois</i> lay quiet in her dock.</p>

<p>“He’s warming her up,” thought Henry. “It’s a good thing, too, for this
is going to be some struggle. I’ll bet the waves are like mountains.”</p>

<p>The captain rang his call-bell. “Send Lieutenant Hill to me,” he said.</p>

<p>The lieutenant came briskly into the cabin. The two officers conferred a
moment. Henry stepped over to the wardroom. Not even the doctor was
there. Cards and books lay on the table in disorder, as they had been
dropped at news of the wireless. Everybody was at his post, preparing.
Henry returned to the cabin. The lieutenant was gone. The commander was
pulling on his oilskins.</p>

<p>“Where can I get a slicker?” Henry inquired.</p>

<p>“Ask Rollin. He will get you one.”</p>

<p>The captain pulled on his sou’wester, tied the strings under his chin,
and mounted to the deck. Henry rang for Rollin and stated his wish. The
attendant brought boots, hat, and slicker. Henry pulled on a sweater,
buttoned his coat up tight, and pulled on the waterproofs.</p>

<p>The gust of wind that struck him as he came out of the companionway sent
him reeling back against that structure. He could hardly catch his
breath. The driving sheets of rain blinded him. He fought his way
forward, and entered the radio shack. The chief electrician was copying
down a message. It was an order for the <i>Iroquois</i> to go to the rescue
of the <i>Capitol City</i>. But Henry knew that it was not needed. Already
the <i>Iroquois</i> was prepared to get under way.</p>

<p>Henry took the message to the bridge and handed it to the commander.
“Tell Sparks to wire that we are leaving Boston to help the <i>Capitol
City</i>,” shouted the captain.</p>

<p>Henry carried the message to Mr. Sharp and watched him send it. Then he
went back to the bridge. The rain beat on him as irresistibly as ever,
but the weather-cloth offered surprising protection from the wind. A
sailor slipped the hawsers over the posts on the pier. Other sailors
drew in the hawsers and stowed them away. The captain pressed his
signal-bell, and the <i>Iroquois</i> began to move astern. She backed out
into the stream and then turned and headed for the sea, into the teeth
of the driving storm.</p>

<p>The beating rain obscured the view. Fog made the shores almost
indistinguishable, for in from the sea, blown on the breath of the icy
blasts, came racing great clouds of murky white vapor that screened all
they touched. The captain looked grim and inscrutable. His jaw was set
hard. He stood by the wheelhouse, conning the ship. At half speed the
<i>Iroquois</i> slowly nosed her way down the channel. Wiped from view was
the beautiful scene that had so delighted Henry a few short hours
before. Nothing could be seen but occasional glimpses of shore, the
tumultuous, muddy water, and the driving curtains of fog.</p>

<p>One by one the captain made the proper turns in the tortuous channel. As
the <i>Iroquois</i> stood farther and farther out toward the sea, the waters
became ever more tumultuous, the winds roared more fiercely, and the fog
shut in ever denser. Fathom by fathom the ship crept past one after
another of the island defenses along the way, that served as breakwaters
to the sea and broke the sweep of the winds. When at last the little
ship turned eastward at George’s Island, and faced the storm with the
last vestige of protection gone, she trembled and shook in the grasp of
the roaring blasts.</p>

<p>A smother of foam was the sea. Waves rose and broke in incredible
confusion. The waters were churned as by a giant hand. The racing winds
whipped the crests from the combers and flung them forward in sheets of
blinding spray. Fog drove onward in clouds, now completely hiding the
sea, now lifting momentarily, to expose the wild waste of tossing
waters. The fury of the storm was indescribable.</p>

<p>Mountain high indeed seemed the waves. Before the bow of the <i>Iroquois</i>
they rose up, up, up, as high as the men on the bridge, then rushed
savagely at the little boat, seemingly bent on her destruction. Down
they crashed, and the nose of the cutter was buried in a smother of
foaming water. Sometimes the crests swept completely over the bow,
pouring over the forward deck in great floods that raced aft and went
foaming out of the scuppers. Now Henry saw why the decks had been
cleared of all movable objects. Indeed, as he watched the smashing
combers crash over the bow, he feared that the big guns themselves would
be torn from their foundations on the iron deck-plates and hurled aft
against the wheelhouse. With blanched face he stood on the bridge,
desperately gripping the rail, and peering with fascinated gaze at the
snarling, hungry seas.</p>

<p>Meantime the captain had sent a reassuring message to the <i>Capitol
City</i>, telling her the <i>Iroquois</i> was on her way to assist her. And when
the ship was fairly in the sea, past all chance of harm by rock or
shoal, the captain left the lieutenant in charge of the bridge and went
himself to the chart-room to plan his coming movements. With him went
Henry. He had seen enough of the sea for a time. Some of the fear that
first gripped his soul had gone. He knew that the <i>Iroquois</i> was safe so
long as she held her course, but he wanted to shut out for a time the
sight of those terrifying billows; so he staggered to the chart-room,
and stepped inside, glad of a relief from the terrible tension that had
held him.</p>

<p>The captain was calmly poring over his charts and guide-books.
“Forty-two north, seventy west,” he muttered, sweeping his glance over
an outstretched map. He placed his pencil on the indicated spot. “She’s
on the shoals almost dead east of Truro,” he said to Henry.</p>

<p>Then he turned to a Coast Guard directory and leafed it over. “Thank
God!” he cried. “There’s a Coast Guard land station near by. It may be
two or three miles distant, but they’ll come with their outfit. They
must have gotten the wireless flash just as we did. It’s likely they’re
on their way now. What a fight that will be—those miles across the sand
with their heavy boats in this wind. They’ll do it, though. But maybe we
can get to the <i>Capitol City</i> before she breaks up. I wish we dared go
faster.”</p>

<p>He stepped out on the bridge and conferred with the lieutenant. “Do you
think that we dare drive her any faster?” he shouted in the latter’s
ear.</p>

<p>The lieutenant shook his head dubiously. “Well, we’ll try it,” said the
commander.</p>

<p>And he stepped into the wheelhouse and signaled for more speed. The
response was terrifying. Under increased power the <i>Iroquois</i> drove
ahead, bit by bit gaining greater momentum. Savagely she charged into
the seas. Wildly the waves leaped to meet her. The impact grew ever more
terrific. Soon a huge mountain of water came roaring down on the little
cutter. Up it rose and up and up, while the cutter charged to meet it,
and as it broke and crashed forward, the cutter dived completely under
it. The shock was terrific. Tons of water crashed down on the deck, then
went racing aft against the superstructure. The <i>Iroquois</i> seemed to
stop in her tracks. She trembled from stem to stern. She shook and
quivered. The great wave went roaring aft, twisting and tearing at the
ship. A section of the rail carried away, and went pounding astern. The
tumult was terrifying. Henry, in the chart-room, thought the ship was
breaking to pieces. With blanched face and set teeth he clung to the
side of the room, not knowing what to do. He was reassured when the
captain calmly stepped inside the wheelhouse and signaled for the
engineer to lessen speed.</p>

<p>Hour after hour they wallowed through the storm. Unflinching, undaunted,
in complete mastery of ship and crew, the captain stood on the bridge,
with his right-hand man. Mile by mile, league after league, he fought
his way eastward. The rain ceased, but the winds blew on, lashing the
seas to fiercer and greater fury. The sky was totally obscured.
Gradually the fog lifted, but not for long was the increased vision.
Darkness came apace, and into that roaring darkness the <i>Iroquois</i> drove
with all the power she dared to use.</p>

<p>With anxious eyes the captain watched the logbook. At times he
telephoned to the chief engineer. Again and again he stepped to the
wheelhouse and looked at the compass. Anon he consulted with the
lieutenant. He must know where he was, in order to get safely round the
long arm of Cape Cod. Nor did he dare stand too close to shore in his
run along the eastward coast of the Cape, lest the storm put the
<i>Iroquois</i> also on the shoals. Dead reckoning alone would tell him when
to turn, and carefully the commander considered every feature that might
indicate his position.</p>

<p>Darkness had long since shut in, and the <i>Iroquois</i> was wallowing
through a night as black as pitch before the captain altered his course
and headed south along the outer edge of the Cape. Gradually the course
of the vessel was shifted. To Henry the change was terrifying. No longer
was the <i>Iroquois</i> breasting the storm. The waves took her abeam. From
side to side she rolled until Henry’s heart stood still with fear. Over
and over and over she dipped until he was certain she would turn upside
down. Then slowly she righted and swung in the opposite direction. And
once, when she rolled at an angle of forty degrees, Henry almost gasped
aloud. It seemed like eternity while the ship lay poised almost on her
beam’s ends, apparently uncertain whether to roll on over or come back
on her keel. Then she slowly righted.</p>

<p>Meantime the chief electrician had been in touch with the stranded ship.
From her signals he knew that she was not far away. They came crackling
out of the air sharp and clear. A distant glow showed that the guardsmen
from the land were already at the scene. At last the <i>Capitol City</i>
wired that she could see the lights of the <i>Iroquois</i>.</p>

<p>“Make a flare,” flashed back the <i>Iroquois’</i> wireless man.</p>

<p>And presently, almost dead to leeward of the <i>Iroquois</i>, the darkness
was torn by a flash, and a flaming rocket went streaking up through the
night. Other rockets followed. Then a flaring light arose, and through
their glasses the men on the bridge of the <i>Iroquois</i> could see the
stricken ship, lying in a smother of foam on the outer edge of the
breakers. She was too far from shore for the land crew to shoot a line
to her, and no small boat could live in such a sea. If the crew of the
<i>Capitol City</i> were to be saved, the little cutter alone could save
them.</p>

<p>Cautiously the <i>Iroquois</i> was worked in toward the shoals. Then slowly
she was turned, the captain gave the word, and one of the anchors was
let go. Once more the cutter was heading again into the seas, and now,
little by little, her anchor-chain was paid out, while seamen with
hand-lines took soundings, calling up to the bridge the depth they
found. Fathom after fathom the giant anchor-chain was paid out. Fathom
after fathom the <i>Iroquois</i> rode backward toward the seething breakers.</p>

<p>Fascinated, Henry watched the attempt to get within reach of the
unfortunate steamer. Gradually the <i>Iroquois</i> drew near to the smother
of white water. The sea was shoaling fast and the tide was running out,
but the captain kept on in the hope that he could get near enough to
shoot a line aboard the <i>Capitol City</i>. His shells, and the shot-line,
loosely wound in the faking-box so that it would run out freely, were
ready for instant use. All that was necessary was to remove the canvas
cover from the little gun on the after rail, insert the charge, and
shoot. But the <i>Iroquois</i> never came within shooting distance. Too
rapidly the water shoaled, and at last, reluctantly, the commander gave
the word and the anchor-chain was held taut. The <i>Iroquois</i> was rolling,
head to the sea, at the very edge of the breakers, but she was too far
away from the <i>Capitol City</i> to put a shot across her.</p>

<p>“Tell them we’ll float a line down to them, and for them to be on the
lookout for it,” the captain ordered the wireless man.</p>

<p>The latter sat down at his key, but a moment later switched off. The
<i>Capitol City’s</i> wireless was failing. He shifted to the blinkers, and
for the first time Henry had opportunity to see the lights on the
yardarm flash and blink. From the <i>Capitol City</i> came answering winks
from aloft.</p>

<p>“They’re looking for our line,” the wireless man informed the captain.</p>

<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left:5.0%; width:90%;'>
  <img src='images/illus-158.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
<p class='caption'>A Coast Guard Cutter Standing by a Stranded Ocean Liner</p>
</div>

<p>Meantime empty kegs had been prepared. A light line was made fast to one
of them, and it was thrown into the sea. Rapidly it floated to leeward,
and as fast as the sea carried it shoreward the line was paid out. The
searchlight of the <i>Iroquois</i> was broken out and its beam kept on the
floating keg. Slowly this bore down on the <i>Capitol City</i>, but it was
too far to one side for that ship to get it. The line was hauled in, and
again it was floated toward the helpless ship. This time a sailor hurled
the keg far to one side of the <i>Iroquois</i>, in the hope that it might now
come close enough to the stranded ship to be caught. But again the
attempt failed. The ebb tide, with its cross current, carried it farther
away from the <i>Capitol City</i> than it had been before.</p>

<p>“Lower the surfboat,” ordered the commander, when he saw the attempt was
useless. Then he called for volunteers. By the dozen the sailors leaped
forward.</p>

<p>“Boatswain Johnson,” said the captain, “I’m going to put you in charge.
Pick your crew.”</p>

<p>The boatswain selected eight sturdy sailors for oarsmen. A life belt was
strapped round each. The boat was lowered to the rail, and the crew
stepped carefully aboard. At a favorable moment the craft was launched.
Quickly she shot away from the side of the <i>Iroquois</i>, and before
another comber broke, she was at a safe distance from the cutter and
heading straight into the breakers.</p>

<p>The ship’s light was trained on her. On she went, now up, now down,
breasting the roaring waves, shooting through the smother of foam,
riding safely where it seemed impossible for a boat to live, under the
skillful guidance of the experienced boatswain. Swiftly she drew toward
the <i>Capitol City</i>, which no longer lay at right angles to the beach,
but had worked a little to one side, making a lee where the water was
calmer. Toward this the boatswain drove the surf boat. Into it the
little craft shot safely, while a sigh of relief went up from the deck
of the <i>Iroquois</i>.</p>

<p>Through powerful glasses, Henry watched breathlessly while the surfboat
drew close to the protected side of the <i>Capitol City</i>. A line was
thrown to the little boat, and a sailor in the bow caught it. Then the
surfboat was drawn close beside the stranded steamer, and a sailor
scrambled down from the rigging and dropped into it.</p>

<p>From seaward a giant comber was rushing toward the tiny craft. If it
caught her, it would crush her against the side of the larger ship as an
eggshell is crushed underfoot. On the <i>Iroquois</i> not a soul breathed.
The onlookers stood tense, waiting the outcome. But the boatswain had an
eye for everything. He, too, saw the great comber approaching. Back from
the steamer’s side drew the little boat, and the wave passed harmlessly
by. Again the surfboat drew up to the side of the <i>Capitol City</i>, and
another man detached himself from the rigging and dropped into it. But
just at that moment a wave, rising apparently from nowhere, swept over
the windward side of the stranded steamer, poured irresistibly across
her deck, and sent its tons of icy water crashing downward into the
little surfboat lying by the leeward rail. The tiny craft was swept from
sight.</p>

<p>“My God!” cried the captain. “They’ve capsized!”</p>

</div>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>LOST IN THE SEA</span>
</h2>

<p>For a moment the crew of the <i>Iroquois</i> stood as though petrified. In
the brilliant beam of the searchlight they could see the dark forms of
their comrades as they bobbed up above the smother of foam. Down from
the bridge and the rigging of the <i>Capitol City</i>, where the members of
her crew had taken refuge from the sweeping waves, these men now came
leaping fearlessly. To rope and life-buoy they ran, and, seizing them,
hurled them far out into the waves toward the struggling men from the
<i>Iroquois</i>. But the strong cross current that had borne the floating keg
so far to one side of the stranded ship, now carried the struggling men
rapidly away from the steamer and the floating buoys. Desperately the
men fought to reach the <i>Capitol City</i>, but the rushing tide beat them
back, sucked them farther and farther away from the ship, and dragged
them out toward the deeper water.</p>

<p>Not long did the men on the <i>Iroquois</i> remain idly watching their
comrades, helpless in the surf. One instant alone they stood as though
paralyzed. Then, as the captain began to bark his terse commands, they
leaped to action. In an instant the anchor-chain was released, and as it
paid out the <i>Iroquois</i> began to move. Driven by wind and wave, she bore
farther into the breakers. A seaman with the lead sounded and roared out
the depths. Rapidly the water shoaled, but the captain let the
<i>Iroquois</i> drive on. He meant to save his men if it were humanly
possible. Rapidly the tide was sweeping them outward. The wind was
pushing the cutter inward. Every second brought the struggling men
nearer to their comrades, who waited with ropes and buoys, at the rail
of the <i>Iroquois</i>.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the <i>Iroquois</i> was jarred from stem to stern. Again and
again, as she rolled in the waves, came that pounding, jarring
sensation. She had struck bottom. She was on the shoals. The captain
signaled for full speed ahead, and shouted an order to the men at the
anchor-chain. The propeller began to revolve slowly, then faster, then
at full speed. The engine on the forward deck began to heave in the
anchor-chain. The <i>Iroquois</i> seemed to pause and gather herself for a
leap. Almost imperceptibly at first, then faster, and then with a rush,
she moved through the water. An oncoming comber, towering toward the
skies, met her bow on, and again the little cutter plunged headlong
under water. A warning cry went up. The men on deck grasped rope and
rail and clung with all their might. The great wave went sweeping aft
like an avenging fury, but not a man was swept away. Instantly the
captain signaled to lessen speed. The <i>Iroquois</i> forged ahead more
slowly, the leadsman sounding continually and shouting the depth to the
commander on the bridge. Soon the cutter rode at a safe depth. The
engines were stopped, the anchor-chain was made fast, and once more the
<i>Iroquois</i> rode safe at the edge of the breakers.</p>

<p>All the while the resistless tide was sweeping the struggling men in the
breakers out toward the <i>Iroquois</i>. One by one they were now borne past
the ship, struggling desperately to reach her side. With trembling hands
eager comrades flung ropes and buoys. All fell short. One man alone came
close, bravely fighting his way to the starboard side of the cutter. A
sailor climbed over the rail and down a ladder, leaned down, and
snatched his struggling comrade as the latter shot upward on the crest
of a wave. At that instant the ship lurched violently to port, the
sailor’s grasp was broken, his comrade was torn from his grip, and the
poor fellow was sucked away by a wave, and, struggling desperately, was
borne out to sea. All about the <i>Iroquois</i> men were fighting with the
waves. In desperation their comrades watched them.</p>

<p>To launch a boat seemed not humanly possible. No little craft could live
in such a sea. But the captain called for volunteers, and as one man the
crew sprang forward.</p>

<p>“Lower away the leeward lifeboat,” roared the captain.</p>

<p>Eager hands unbent the gripes, the falls were loosened, and the lifeboat
dropped level with the rail. Into her leaped the chosen crew, with the
executive officer in command. Down went the boat. For a moment it rode
the waves in safety, and pulled out toward the struggling men in the
sea. It had almost reached the nearest when a swirling comber rose
beside it, towered a second above it, and then came crashing down on it,
burying men and boat under tons of yeasty water.</p>

<p>For a moment, boat and men were completely lost to sight. Far down
beneath the swirling seas the ill-fated crew of the lifeboat had been
thrust by the towering comber. The moving searchlight showed no human
form among the savage seas. Then suddenly the sea was full of struggling
men. Some fought their way to the overturned boats and clung to them.
Those whose grips had loosened were seized by their comrades and dragged
back to the pitiful security of a hold on a floating boat. Some could
not gain even this slender assistance.</p>

<p>At this instant the tide turned. Far to seaward the men from that first
ill-fated boat had now been swept, out into the blackness of the night,
past the possibility of assistance. But the struggling crew of the other
boat were now borne slowly shoreward. Now wave and wind combined to wash
them toward the distant sands. It did not seem possible that they could
safely pass through that seething caldron. With incredible fury the
waves beat down upon them. Like chips in a mill race they were tossed
helplessly this way and that. But every man of them wore a life belt,
and despite the buffeting of the seas all remained afloat and alive.
Bravely they continued to fight for their lives.</p>

<p>Two boats had been swamped. Two crews were battling for life in the
waves, and one was irrevocably lost. But men still pressed forward and
begged to be allowed to try again. No boat could live in such an awful
sea, yet the men of the <i>Iroquois</i> pleaded for a chance, a last chance,
to save their comrades. The captain ordered one more boat lowered. Like
its predecessors, it lived but a few minutes in the awful sea.</p>

<p>Three boats had now been capsized, and three crews were struggling in
the sea. Many were clinging to the overturned boats, while others had
gained some of the buoys thrown to the crew of the first overturned
boat. Numbers were swimming unaided. The sea was full of boats and
floating men. Impotent, heartsick, torn with anguish, the men remaining
on the <i>Iroquois</i> stood watching the awful sight. They had done their
best. They had done all that human beings could possibly do, but it was
not enough. There was nothing else they could do but pray, and many an
agonized seaman, rough as a barnacle, stood with tears streaming down
his rugged face and prayed for his comrades struggling for their lives
in that awful sea.</p>

<p>Perhaps those prayers were heard. With every minute the incoming tide
ran stronger, washing the struggling men toward shore, where now were
burning the welcome beacons of the crews from landward Coast Guard
stations. Again and again they tried to launch their surfboats, and as
often were beaten back. Now they stood at the edge of the waves, waiting
to assist their comrades from the ship.</p>

<p>Ceaselessly the searchlight of the <i>Iroquois</i> played upon the breakers,
and on her bridge officers stood with glasses and watched the awful
fight. Miraculously the struggling men drove steadily toward the shore.
Soon they were in shallow water. They touched bottom. And now, fighting
their way upward on the sand, they struggled through the breakers. Again
and again inward-rushing waves beat them down, but always they were
flung forward, tossed landward, driven farther toward the sandy beach
and safety. The flaming fires before them heartened them, encouraged
them. New strength came to them, and singly, in pairs, and even in
little groups, they battled their way onward. The strong helped the
weak, and one or two were seen dragging comrades who were wholly
helpless. Out into the breakers rushed the waiting guards from the
shore. Strong arms were thrown around weak and fainting forms, and limp
bodies were carried bodily through the waves. Again and again the sturdy
guardsmen from the shore rushed back into the waves and aided more men
ashore, while others toiled to resuscitate the few who had all but
succumbed.</p>

<p>Around the fires now pressed the rescued seamen, increasing in number as
man after man gained the sands, until they formed a great ring about the
flames. Their numbers brought joy to the watchers on the <i>Iroquois</i>. Now
the rescued men were seen to be leaving the fire and trooping off into
the darkness.</p>

<p>The commander was talking to the quartermaster, who had been kept at his
post during all the struggle. “We must be a little farther along the
coast than I thought,” said the captain. “They must be taking our men to
a Coast Guard station. Tell Sparks to get in touch with the station and
find how many men were saved.”</p>

<p>The quartermaster climbed down the ladder and made his way to the radio
shack. Young Belford was on duty. “Where is Mr. Sharp?” demanded the
quartermaster.</p>

<p>“Gone,” said the young wireless man, and there were tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Gone! You don’t mean he went in a boat?”</p>

<p>The radio man nodded. For a moment he could not speak, then he managed
to say, “I saw him leap into the last boat.” And a great sob broke from
him.</p>

<p>“He may be safe,” said the quartermaster. “Most of the men got ashore.
We could see them with the glasses.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope so!” cried the lad.</p>

<p>The quartermaster ran up on the bridge again. “The chief radio man is
gone,” he said. “He pulled an oar in the last boat.”</p>

<p>“Find young Harper,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“I saw him on deck helping the sailors.”</p>

<p>“Send him to me.”</p>

<p>When the quartermaster had summoned Henry, the commander said to him,
his voice quivering with emotion, “Lad, Mr. Sharp is gone. He was in the
last boat. Are you sure you can operate our wireless? We need it now as
we never needed it before.”</p>

<p>“I can,” said Henry quietly.</p>

<p>“Then try to get in touch with this land station. I don’t know which one
it is. I thought that we were opposite Truro. We’re somewhere in that
neighborhood. Find which station it is, and ask how many men got
ashore.”</p>

<p>“But what about Belford?” asked Henry. “He’s the regular assistant.
Oughtn’t he to do it?”</p>

<p>The captain glared angrily at Henry. Then he comprehended what was in
the boy’s mind. “Send Belford to me,” he said. “It’s no time for
etiquette now. I want action.”</p>

<p>“You shall have it,” said Henry, and he hastened to the radio shack.</p>

<p>“Belford,” he said, as he closed the door to shut out the howl of the
wind, “the captain has asked me to send a message. He wants you to
report to the bridge.”</p>

<p>Henry sat down at the desk, hastily searched through the list of Coast
Guard station calls, and began combing the air with the wireless to
carry out the captain’s wishes. Meantime young Belford mounted to the
bridge and stood before his commander.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said the captain, “Mr. Harper is going to take charge of
the wireless. He’s a former government operator and has had much
experience. I am sorry to go over your head, but we must all do our
best. It’s a trying time.”</p>

<p>“I will help all I can,” said the assistant operator loyally.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the commander. “Go back to the wireless house. Tell
Mr. Harper to come to me the instant he gets word from shore.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the radio man, and he hurried back to his post.</p>

<p>Meantime Henry had been flashing abroad call after call. He had just got
his station when young Belford came back. A moment more and his great
question was answered. He turned from his key, his face aglow.</p>

<p>“The captain wants to see you the minute you’re done,” said young
Belford.</p>

<p>Henry rose and sought the bridge. “Captain Hardwick,” he cried, “every
man except the crew of the first boat is accounted for. They are all
safe at the station.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” cried the commander. For a moment he could not speak. Then,
in husky tones, he said, “Henry, I’ve told young Belford that you are in
charge of the radio. Don’t feel any hesitation about taking charge.
There is now a vacancy in our radio staff. You are regularly appointed
to the vacancy and detailed to act as chief.”</p>

</h2>

<p>Under other circumstances the captain’s words would have caused Henry to
shout with joy. Now there was no sense of jubilation in his heart. He
was stunned by the awful catastrophe that had occurred. Nine men that he
had been living with, and had come to like, had suddenly been wiped out
of existence. The horror of it had laid hold upon every soul on the
<i>Iroquois</i>. Perhaps it was fortunate for those still left on the ship
that there was so much to be done. There was no time for brooding, or
mourning for lost comrades. The roar of the storm in the darkness was
terrifying. The winds still were shrieking through the cordage. Enormous
waves were sweeping down on the sturdy little cutter, threatening to
overwhelm her. Only a bit of iron, a length of chain, stood between the
<i>Iroquois</i> and a fate like that of the <i>Capitol City</i>; and a chain is no
stronger than its weakest link. There might be a weak link in the chain
of the <i>Iroquois</i>. Her work must be ended and the little ship taken out
of danger as quickly as possible. Every soul on board felt this
distinctly. Perhaps no one felt it more strongly than Henry did. The
unaccustomed violence of the sea appalled him. So the office that had
come to him so suddenly did not for a moment seem to him to be a matter
of personal advancement. It was a call to duty. It was his chance to
help forward the work the <i>Iroquois</i> had set out to do.</p>

<p>Very sober was Henry as he reentered the radio shack. “Belford,” he
said, “the captain thinks my experience as an operator will make me
useful on the <i>Iroquois</i> until Mr. Sharp can get aboard again. He has
asked me to take charge of the wireless room. I did not want to do it,
for you should be in charge. But the captain has asked me to help, and
all I can do is to obey. You’ll help me, won’t you, Belford? You’ll pull
with us, won’t you? We’ve got to work together and do our best or we may
never get out of this situation.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ll help you. Don’t give the matter another thought. I’ll
help you just as loyally as I would help Mr. Sharp,” and the lad held
out his hand.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Belford,” said Henry, grasping his hand. “The wireless will
mean a lot to the <i>Iroquois</i> in the next twenty-four hours. We’ll both
stand by the captain to the finish.” Then he added: “Where’s Black? I
want to talk to him, too.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where he is,” said Belford. “I can’t remember seeing him for
several hours past. Mr. Sharp was on watch the first four hours after we
left Boston, and I stood watch the next four. Black ought to be on duty
now. But there’s been so much excitement I never thought about whose
watch it was.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose he went in one of the boats, do you?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” said Belford. “And yet he might. I’ll see.”</p>

<p>He went to the stateroom. Soon he reappeared with a peculiar expression
on his face. “He’s in bed,” he said, “and has been abed all the while
we’ve been trying to save the <i>Capitol City</i>.”</p>

<p>The two young operators looked at each other. The same sickening
suspicion was in the mind of each. But both hesitated to put it into
words.</p>

<p>At that moment the quartermaster entered the room. “The captain wants
you to talk to the <i>Capitol City</i>,” he said, “and find out how fast she
is taking water, and how deep it is where she lies.”</p>

<p>“You do that,” said Henry to his companion. “You’ve had lots of
experience with the blinkers. I haven’t had any.”</p>

<p>Young Belford set the blinkers to winking merrily. The response was
immediate. Colored lights began to flash aloft on the <i>Capitol City’s</i>
yardarm. That vessel was resting easily on the sands, came the answer,
and was taking in water no faster than her pumps could pump it out
again. The tide was rising rapidly. It was already six feet deep. This
news the assistant operator carried to the commander.</p>

<p>“We’ll save her yet,” said the captain. “This tide is going to be a very
high one, if I am any judge. The wind’s been blowing the water shoreward
now a full twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>Rapidly the water rose. As the captain had said, the wind had been
blowing it shoreward for a full day. The ebb tide had shown what the
wind could do, for the water was far higher than usual when the tide
turned to flood. Wind and wave both pressed the flood landward, and now
the tide, running in with the wind, mounted and mounted until it was
evident that the captain’s hope was to be realized. As the tide rose and
the water about the cutter deepened, Captain Hardwick put a leadsman to
sounding.</p>

<p>“We must work in with the tide, Lieutenant,” he said to his assistant on
the bridge, “and be ready for action the instant the tide is at flood.
It won’t wait a second for us, though, if this wind holds, it will delay
the ebb. We must not lose a moment.”</p>

<p>Long before the tide was full, Captain Hardwick ordered the anchor-chain
released. At once the cutter began to move toward the beach, very slowly
at first, then faster and faster as wind and wave gave her momentum. The
lead was kept going incessantly, the leadsman shouting the depths up to
the bridge as he made his soundings. Foot by foot, fathom by fathom, the
<i>Iroquois</i> drew nearer the <i>Capitol City</i>. Steadily the cutter’s
searchlight played on the disabled ship, its brilliant beam boring
through the inky dark.</p>

<p>Slowly, almost imperceptibly, yet none the less truly, the wind abated
its violence. Less often the great waves swept over the deck of the
stranded steamship. Not so shrill was the screeching of the <i>Iroquois’</i>
cordage. The captain, with his wide experience, had evidently foreseen a
change in the weather. He was evidently expecting the wind to fall, and
if it did, it would help in the effort to float the stranded vessel, for
a great pressure against the ship would be removed. But as the minutes
passed, the wind did not become noticeably less. It still howled
angrily, and swept with fitful force over ship and wave. Now it came in
gusts, blowing furiously for a time, then lulling. But without ceasing
the tide drove in, and the waves crept further and further up the sides
of the stranded steamship, and the combers crashed ever higher up the
sandy beach.</p>

<p>Fathom after fathom the <i>Iroquois</i> followed the rising tide shoreward.
When the lead showed questionable depths, the anchor-chain was made
fast, and the little cutter paused for a while in her progress, marking
time, as it were, to the music of the storm. With unwonted rapidity the
tide mounted up, and Captain Hardwick followed it as fast and as far as
he dared.</p>

<p>Plainly there was a good chance to save the <i>Capitol City</i>. As the two
ships came closer, every detail of the stranded ship was visible. She
had suffered astonishingly little, when the violence of the storm was
considered. She lay almost on an even keel. Though not pointing directly
to the waves, the stern was so nearly in line with them that they were
parted as they reached her, sweeping past with little damage to her
hull. A section of her taffrail was gone, and a part of her rudder was
broken off. Otherwise she appeared to have suffered little, and the
success of the pumps in keeping down the water in the hold showed that
even her plates had not been badly started. Her superstructure had
suffered little. One of her small boats had been washed away, but
otherwise she seemed to the watchers on the <i>Iroquois</i> to be in
remarkably good condition.</p>

<p>What was more important, her crew was intact. Huddled high on the bridge
and in the rigging, they had crouched together while the men from the
<i>Iroquois</i> were trying to reach them. But as the tide ran low, those in
the rigging had climbed down and mounted to the bridge and
superstructure, seeking warmth, for the piercing winds had well-nigh
frozen them as they clung to the rattling stays. Apparently not a man
had been swept from the <i>Capitol City</i>. Almost the full crew was there
to work the ship, and Captain Hardwick was glad, indeed, that there was
no such shortage of hands on the <i>Capitol City</i> as existed on the
<i>Iroquois</i>. There would be work for many hands when the time was ripe
for the effort he had in mind.</p>

<p>At last the <i>Iroquois</i> came within reach of her stranded sister. Now a
line could easily be fired across the helpless vessel. Ready was the
faking-box with the shot-line faked neatly on the tall spindles within
it, ready to run out smoothly as it traveled through the air on its
momentous journey. The little brass gun on the after-rail of the
<i>Iroquois</i> was uncovered, a charge was inserted in it, its Camden
projectile, with shot-line bent fast, projected from the muzzle of the
little gun, and all was ready for the effort. The captain himself
sighted the little gun, for the gunner, alas! had been in the
<i>Iroquois’</i> surfboat. A moment the commander waited, until the cutter
rode on an even keel.</p>

<p>“Fire,” he called.</p>

<p>There was a loud explosion, the night was stabbed with a sheet of flame,
and the projectile went hurtling out and up, tearing its way across the
hundreds of yards of raging sea that still separated the two ships. For
an instant those on board the <i>Iroquois</i> were blinded by the flash of
their gun. Then they tried to trace, in the glare of the searchlight,
the flight of the shot-line. Straight and true it winged its way toward
the stranded ship. Then a rush of scurrying forms on the <i>Capitol City</i>
told the watchers on the Iroquois that the shot had carried true. In a
moment more the crew of the <i>Capitol City</i> were hauling in the little
shot-line.</p>

<p>Already a heavier line had been bent to the end of the light shot-line,
but first it had been passed out through one of the quarter chocks.
Steadily the crew of the <i>Capitol City</i> drew this heavier line aboard
their craft. This in turn was followed by a heavy hawser. But Captain
Hardwick had no intention of risking defeat through the use of so
uncertain a towing line as a manila hawser. He meant to make fast to the
<i>Capitol City</i> with a wire cable. To that end young Belford had been
busy with the blinkers, and the flashing lights of the <i>Capitol City’s</i>
yardarm had answered back. Captain Hardwick had apprised his
fellow-commander of his intention, and warned him of the necessity of
heaving the heavy wire cable an inch at a time, as it was paid out
cautiously by the <i>Iroquois</i>. No buoyancy had this line, like a manila
hawser. Like a plummet it would drop to the bottom of the sea, and once
it started to run, out it would go its full length.</p>

<p>Steadily the rope hawser was paid out, and steadily it was pulled aboard
the <i>Capitol City</i>. Then the end of the wire cable, bent to the hawser,
was lowered, and foot by foot, with a caution hardly credible, the
handful of men on the <i>Iroquois</i> responded to the tug on the line and
let the wire cable slide through the quarter chock. At the same time
Captain Hardwick drifted the <i>Iroquois</i> closer and closer to the vessel
on the shoals.</p>

<p>At last the steel cable was aboard the <i>Capitol City</i>, and safe about
her bitts. The other end was now made fast to the bitts of the
<i>Iroquois</i>. The great, unbreakable, steel cable now stretched from ship
to ship. With all the power at her command, the little cutter would
presently strain at this line. At this same time she would heave in her
anchor-chain, and the vast length of this enormous chain, reaching
hundreds of fathoms out into the ocean, and weighing tons upon tons,
would add to the anchor a gripping force that would hold like the rock
of Gibraltar. Like a man pulling himself up a rope, arm over arm, the
little cutter would heave itself along the length of this anchor-chain
with the full power of both its propeller and its heaving engine, and
behind it would come the <i>Capitol City</i>—perhaps.</p>

<p>Time alone would tell. And now all was ready. Steam was up on both
ships, ready for the supreme effort. It remained only for the tide to
reach flood, but how slowly it now seemed to advance. Up and up it rose,
creeping higher and higher up the sides of the stranded ship, the lacy
edges of the waves foaming ever higher on the sandy beach. Anxiously the
captain kept his watch. Now, with careful eye, he studied the heavens.
Now he bent his gaze upon the tumultuous sea. Now he went forward, and
with his own hands examined the anchor-chain and looked at all its
mechanism for heaving. Again he went aft and studied the arrangement of
the hawser, appraising with practised eye the lay of the two vessels,
the sweep of the waves, the movement of the tide.</p>

<p>High indeed this was, and as the water mounted ever higher on the
<i>Capitol City’s</i> side, and the leadsman found more and more depth
beneath the <i>Iroquois</i>, the captain’s face showed ever-growing
confidence. From time to time he talked with the master of the <i>Capitol
City</i>, with young Belford as his intermediary. Anon he studied the skies
and noted with satisfaction the steady abatement of the wind. As the
time drew near for the tide to be at flood, the eager commander paced
the deck, impatient for the trial. Yet with eagle eye he watched the
tide. At last the critical moment arrived. The commander’s judgment told
him it was time to be moving. The tide was not yet quite at flood, but
it was high, extremely high. It would not mount much higher. When it
turned, the very volume of it would cause it to run out fast.</p>

<p>Briskly he mounted to the bridge. “Tell the <i>Capitol City</i> we’re going
to move,” he called to the radio man. “Tell the captain to put on full
speed astern.”</p>

<p>Above, the blinker lights flashed forth their calls, and promptly from
the <i>Capitol City</i> came answering flashes. The ship would turn on her
power. Meantime the indicator in the engine room of the <i>Iroquois</i>
communicated its message to the men at the engines. The propeller began
to move, slowly at first, then faster, then at full speed. Forward, the
heaving engine began to strain at the anchor-cable. The little cutter
trembled and shook with the effort. Loud rumbled the churning machinery
in her hold.</p>

<p>Minute followed minute. The little craft strained and pulled. She rose
and fell in the sea. Her propeller churned the waters into yeasty foam.
Link by link the anchor-chain was heaved in. Foot by foot the <i>Iroquois</i>
crept ahead, but she was only making the wire cable taut. The <i>Capitol
City</i> had not budged. Glasses to eyes, the captain studied the great
steamer as her propeller drove round and round in the swirling water.
Critically he watched the waves sweep past her sides, for continually
the glaring light of the <i>Iroquois</i> was focused on the helpless steamer.
Still the tide rose higher, though now but slowly. Every inch counted
now. A few more inches and the vessel on the sands ought almost to float
of herself.</p>

<p>On deck the sailors watched the tide with anxious eyes. Well they knew
what a little more water would mean to the success of their efforts.
From time to time they dropped bits of wood over the sides, to see
whether the tide was still carrying toward the shore. Anon they studied
the wire cable now stretched tighter than a fiddlestring. The tide
continued to rise, though now almost imperceptibly. Then it hesitated,
halted, and stood still. It was at flood. With every ounce of power they
possessed the two steamships strained and struggled. The tide paused, as
though to give them ample opportunity. Then, almost imperceptibly, it
turned and began to flow out toward the sea. And at that instant the
lights on the <i>Capitol City</i> flashed forth, and a moment later young
Belford came racing up to the bridge with a message for the captain.</p>

<p>“The <i>Capitol City</i> is moving,” he said. Then he turned and raced back
to his post.</p>

<p>A shout went up as the sailors sensed the import of his message. Every
eye was focused on the stranded steamer. For a moment no motion was
discernible in her. Then plainly she could be seen to move. The shout
was followed by a cheer, for now the big steamer was plainly ploughing
through the waves. Little by little she gained momentum. Moment by
moment the Iroquois drove ahead faster. But it was no easy task that
faced her. No tractable tow was this behind her. With broken rudder, and
advancing stern foremost, the <i>Capitol City</i> yawed badly. Nevertheless,
she came on behind the <i>Iroquois</i>, as the latter forged ahead, heaving
in her anchor-chain fathom after fathom, and fighting her way out to the
depths.</p>

<p>By the time the anchor was heaved aboard, the wind had lessened
markedly. No longer was it blowing from the east. It was shifting,
working around to the north. The tide now was running out strong. There
was no danger that either wind or tide would carry the rescued vessel
back to the shoals again. When the captain of the <i>Iroquois</i> judged it
to be safe, he stopped the cutter. With great care the crew of the
<i>Capitol City</i> shifted the towing cable from stern to bow, and made it
fast to the forward bitts. When this was done, the <i>Iroquois</i> pointed
her nose into the wind, gradually got under way, and with the disabled
steamer behind her, headed once more for the city of Paul Revere. It was
the nearest harbor in which the crippled vessel could find refuge.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>HENRY FINDS HE HAS AN ENEMY</span>
</h2>

<p>Slowly the staunch little cutter steamed ahead. Had it not been for the
broken rudder, the <i>Capitol City</i> could have gone on her way,
unattended, as she was little damaged. But with her rudder injured, she
was in a bad way. Although it was not entirely gone, and it helped
somewhat in guiding the ship, still at times the huge craft yawed badly.
By paying out more cable Captain Hardwick partly overcame this tendency
to yaw. Nevertheless it was difficult enough to make headway, for the
wind had now whipped around almost to the north, and for a time the two
ships had to sail into the teeth of it. The <i>Capitol City</i> could not use
the full power of her engines, but she kept her propeller turning, and
this greatly lessened the burden on the cutter. Unless some unforeseen
difficulty should arise, the two vessels would have no trouble in
reaching their port.</p>

<p>There was much to be done on both ships, however. The captain of the
disabled steamer wanted to get in touch with his agents, and inform them
of the safety of the vessel. His wireless was still out of commission,
and his messages had first to be sent to the <i>Iroquois</i> by blinkers and
then relayed by wireless. So both Henry and his friend Belford were kept
busy for a long time. Then, too, Henry had to get in touch with the
Coast Guard land station where the men from the <i>Iroquois</i> had found
shelter, and send instructions concerning them. The captain felt that he
could operate the <i>Iroquois</i> with his little force for the short run to
Boston and thence to New York. His men were willing to do double duty.
It was necessary for him to get back to New York at the earliest
possible moment. The run to Boston would require only a few hours. Then
he could retrace his steps immediately. It was simpler to have the
seamen go direct to New York and rejoin the <i>Iroquois</i> there, than to
wait for them in Boston. So Henry got in touch with the land station and
communicated the captain’s orders to that effect.</p>

<p>By the time the two young wireless men had finished their tasks, they
were about worn out. It was far into the night. Belford had been on duty
for many hours. Henry, though not on duty so long, was almost exhausted
by the nervous strain under which he had been working. Furthermore, he
would have to respond, at any moment, to any call for wireless
communication.</p>

<p>“We must get to bed,” he said the moment their tasks were done. “Won’t
you please call the other operator? Then we can arrange our watches.”</p>

<p>Belford summoned Black, who came into the radio shack, yawning. “I guess
you’ll have to stand watch for a while, Black,” said Henry. “Things have
got a little mixed up in the wireless house, but we’ll get them
straightened out shortly. Suppose you stay until breakfast. That won’t
be long. Then we can rearrange our watches.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t my regular watch,” said the young radio man, sullenly. “And
why should you be telling me what to do, anyway? That’s up to Mr.
Sharp.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Sharp isn’t here,” replied Henry. “He went in one of the boats.
I am working with you men. We’ve got to do the best we can under the
circumstances. We’ll get things straightened out soon, and back in their
old order.”</p>

<p>“And do you think I am going to take orders from you?” said the young
operator, insolently.</p>

<p>Henry’s face flushed. An angry light leaped to his eyes, and his fist
involuntarily clenched. But he took a grip on himself, and replied very
slowly and deliberately: “It isn’t a question of taking orders, Black.
The captain has asked me to work with you two men, and the three of us
must pull together until we get the ship safe home. Aren’t you willing
to do your share? Belford here has been working like a Trojan for I
don’t know how many hours. He’s all worn out. We want you to take this
trick. You’ll have to watch close, for there’ll likely be calls for us.
Summon me at once if you hear our call.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I can answer a call as well as anybody on this boat,” growled
the scowling radio man.</p>

<p>“See here, Black,” said Henry. “Why do you want to make trouble? We’re
still at sea, and we’ve got some tall traveling to do before we are back
safe in New York. We’ve all got to pull together. I’m not asking you to
do this for me. It’s for the good of the ship.” And then, noting the
sullen look in the lad’s eyes, Henry continued: “There’s one thing more.
I’m acting under orders from the captain. He has ordered me to take
charge of the wireless. My instructions are to let no one touch the key
but myself. All I can do is to pass those orders along. If you hear a
call for the <i>Iroquois</i>, waken me at once. I’ll answer it.”</p>

<p>Young Black mumbled an unwilling assent, and swore under his breath.
Henry and the other radio man passed out of the shack to the stateroom.
They noticed that the wind had decreased greatly.</p>

<p>Once in the stateroom, Henry turned to his companion. “What do you
suppose ails that fellow, Black?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. None of us can make him out. He’s been snappy and surly
ever since he came aboard a few months ago. He’s lazy—too lazy to study
and practice and become a really good operator. But he is quick and
reads wireless calls very well. He spends most of his time smoking
cigarettes and reading dime novels. He’s simply crazy to use the
wireless. He thinks he’s a great operator. The chief electrician would
be glad to let him practice under his own supervision, the way he does
with me. But he doesn’t want either of us to send when he isn’t present.
He’s afraid we might burn out something. I don’t want to knock Black,
but I’d be afraid to have him monkey with any machine I was responsible
for myself. He’s the most careless, reckless fellow I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“But why should he take such an apparent dislike to me?” demanded Henry.
“I’m a complete stranger to him. He hasn’t any possible reason for
disliking me.”</p>

<p>“He thinks he has,” said Belford.</p>

<p>“He does? What is it?”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Sharp let you send a message on the wireless outfit yourself.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Sharp was right beside me, to make sure I did no harm.”</p>

<p>“I know it, but that doesn’t make any difference with a fellow like
Black. He dislikes you very much. He tried to tell me a long story about
it. And to have you put over him as chief is more than he can stand.
He’s a bad egg, I believe. And I’d watch him closely if I were you.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll watch him, if he’s likely to shirk his duty,” said
Henry. “He might get the ship into trouble.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to watch him in that way. Watch him on your own account. I
don’t know that he’d really do anything to anybody. But he’s always
talking about fixing this fellow or that fellow. He might try to do you
some harm.”</p>

<p>Henry smiled. “There’s little danger,” he said. “We’ll be in New York in
a couple of days, and I’ll probably never see him again after that.”</p>

<p>But though Henry smiled at the idea of the young operator’s doing him
harm, he could not dismiss from his mind so easily the feeling that had
come to him of uneasiness for the boat itself. He got his nightclothes
from the captain’s cabin, undressed, and slipped into the chief
operator’s bunk. But weary though he was, he could not sleep. He was
worried, and worry was almost a new sensation to him. He could not at
first understand it. He would be almost asleep, then he would wake up
with a start, his leg or arm jerking nervously. It was partly the
reaction from the long strain he had been under. That sort of experience
was absolutely new to him, and he could not forget the horrible things
he had witnessed. But gradually he came to realize that there was
something more to his restlessness than the reaction from nervous
strain. Something was preying on his mind. After he had tossed
sleeplessly on his mattress for a long time, he comprehended what was
the matter. He was worried about the wireless.</p>

<p>This was the first time in his life that Henry had ever been placed in a
situation of great responsibility. The responsibility was very real,
too, for the lad understood that in large measure the safety of the ship
now depended upon him. Much more than his own life was at stake. The
lives of all the men left on the cutter, and the safety of the ship
herself, might at any moment become absolutely dependent upon him. If no
danger threatened aboard the <i>Iroquois</i>, there might yet be other lives
and other ships endangered, and upon how well his instruments were cared
for, and how thoroughly the watch was kept, would depend the possibility
of catching those far-flung cries for help.</p>

<p>Had Henry been put in charge of the wireless thus suddenly and
unexpectedly, under less harrowing circumstances, he doubtless would
have felt the responsibility far less poignantly. But for hours past he
had been watching the fight against death, and even death itself. He was
nervously keyed up to a fearfully high pitch. His nerves would not let
down. Doubtless it was the sense of responsibility that kept them taut.
Again and again he told himself that it was his business to go to sleep
and rest, so that he might be fit for duty when his turn came. But his
arguments had no effect upon his nerves. He was unable to sleep.</p>

<p>For an hour or two he tossed in his bunk restlessly. Again and again he
fell asleep, only to wake a few minutes later. The situation preyed on
him. He could not keep his thoughts away from the radio shack. Suppose
all was not right there. Suppose young Black was taking this time to
defy orders and fool with the wireless key. Suppose when Henry woke up
he should find the wireless out of commission. And suppose the
<i>Iroquois</i> should break her rudder, or crack her shaft. She might, with
such a strain on it, in such a sea. Suppose the captain should go wrong
in his reckoning and the cutter should pile up on the sands, as the
<i>Capitol City</i> had done. Suppose—suppose——A hundred terrifying
suppositions came into Henry’s mind. Finally he could stand them no
longer. He rose, drew on his clothes, and made his way toward the radio
shack. Light was beginning to illumine the eastern sky. The sea still
heaved violently, but the wind had lost most of its force. Peace was
returning to the troubled world.</p>

<p>Then Henry stepped inside of the radio shack, and stood as though
petrified. Young Black lay back in his chair, his eyes tightly closed,
snoring loudly. He was sound asleep. For all that Henry knew, he might
have been asleep for a long time.</p>

<p>“Black,” said Henry sternly, touching the sleeping wireless man on the
shoulder. When the sleeper merely grunted, Henry said, still more
sternly, “Wake up!” And this time he shook the sleeper vigorously.</p>

<p>Slowly young Black opened his eyes. A savage oath burst from his lips as
he saw who was standing before him and realized his situation. Then a
crafty look came into his eyes. He laughed.</p>

<p>“Fooled you that time, didn’t I?” he chuckled. “You thought I was
asleep.”</p>

<p>“No, you <i>didn’t</i> fool me,” said Henry. “I don’t <i>think</i> you were
asleep. I know it. Put on your headphones and attend to your business.”</p>

<p>All the ill nature in the other lad’s being leaped to the front. “You
spy!” he snarled, with an oath. “So that’s the sort of chief radio man
we’ve got, is it? A sneaking spy!”</p>

<p>For a moment it was all Henry could do to keep from hitting the lad. But
he took a grip on himself and for a moment made no answer. Then he said:
“I shall report this matter to the captain as soon as possible. You may
go to your bunk. I will finish your watch myself.”</p>

<p>Slowly the third-class radio man arose and left the shack. At the door
he turned and faced Henry. “You sneaking spy,” he said, with another
oath, “if you tell the captain, I’ll fix you as sure as my name is
Black.”</p>

</h2>

<p>Henry gave slight heed to the young operator’s threat. Not for one
second did he fear violence from him. Should any physical encounter
occur, he was sure he could take care of himself, and he saw no other
way in which young Black could harm him. He believed his own word would
be taken quicker than Black’s. Knowing that he had done no wrong, and
that he intended to do none, he saw no way in which his rebellious
assistant could do him an injury. So, as soon as he could, he dismissed
the matter from his mind.</p>

<p>But on account of the excitement accompanying his little encounter with
Black, it was not altogether easy to forget the matter. When Henry
remembered that Black had been asleep at the key, and that some one
might have been trying to talk to the <i>Iroquois</i>, he drew on the
headphones and for a space sat listening. Then he threw over his switch,
flashed out a general call, and asked if any one had been calling the
<i>Iroquois</i>. When, after listening and repeating the message, there came
no response, he felt relieved. He sat back in his chair, satisfied that
all was right.</p>

<p>After breakfast Belford came on duty, according to agreement. He
expressed his surprise at finding Henry in the wireless shack. Henry
told him what had happened. Young Belford frowned deeply.</p>

<p>“Be careful, Harper,” he said. “I never trusted Black. He might try to
do you some harm.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how he could,” said Henry. “There are too many people
about.”</p>

<p>“Just the same I wouldn’t spend too much time out on deck after dark.
There’s seldom any one out there except the watch forward.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry it happened,” remarked Henry. “I hate to tell on him.”</p>

<p>“But you must,” urged Belford. “If you don’t, he’ll think he has scared
you out of it. Then he’ll be worse than ever. And he ought to be
punished, if only to make him more careful in future. You can’t tell
what might happen if the wireless watch goes to sleep.”</p>

<p>“I shall report him, of course, but, none the less, I dislike to do it.
It almost makes me feel like the spy he said I was.”</p>

<p>“Don’t feel that way. What you are doing you are doing for the safety of
the ship.”</p>

<p>Henry surrendered the watch to Belford and went straight to the
captain’s cabin. “Come in,” said the captain, when Henry knocked.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Captain Hardwick,” said Henry, as he entered the cabin.
“I have come to you on a disagreeable business. I have to report young
Black for carelessness about his work.”</p>

<p>The captain looked at Henry keenly. “Have you boys been quarreling?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you’d think that was about the size of it,” responded
Henry, “and I was very reluctant to bother you with the matter at all.
But I thought I really owed it to you, Captain Hardwick. I could not
sleep after the excitement last night, and I dressed and went to the
wireless room. Black was on duty, and I found him fast asleep.”</p>

<p>The captain’s face grew dark as a thundercloud. “Asleep at the wireless
key!” he said. “It was indeed your duty to report the matter to me. I’ll
break that fellow quick. We’ll have him before a court-martial and clap
him in the brig, and he’ll be dishonorably discharged the minute we
reach shore.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t do that, Captain Hardwick. I should hate to think I had
made a fellow lose his job. Maybe he’ll do better in future. Won’t you
let him off with a reprimand or some slight punishment?”</p>

<p>The captain looked at Henry searchingly. “I can’t exactly understand
you,” he said. “You report a man for wrong-doing and then don’t want him
punished. Can you explain that?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, he ought to be reported. That’s plain enough. Maybe he ought
to be punished, too. But if he is punished, it will look as though I was
simply trying to get even with him. I wouldn’t want anybody, even Black,
to think I was so small as that.”</p>

<p>“Get even with him!” cried the captain. “Then you did have a quarrel. I
can’t seem to get head or tail of this business.”</p>

<p>“It was like this, Captain,” said Henry, seeing now that he could no
longer keep anything back. “I found Black asleep. I told him I would
report him to you. We had some words. But please don’t think I’m
reporting Black because I’m sore at him, or anything like that.”</p>

<p>“I begin to understand,” nodded the captain. “Is there any one else who
knows about this affair?”</p>

<p>“No one was present, sir, but Belford knows about it.”</p>

<p>“Send him to me,” said the commander.</p>

<p>Henry relieved his fellow-operator at the key, and Belford went direct
to the cabin. He told the captain all he knew about the affair.</p>

<p>“I think I understand now,” said the commander. “Harper told Black he
would report him, and Black called him a spy. That went hard with Henry.
He couldn’t help feeling he was a sort of spy, even though he was doing
his plain duty.”</p>

<p>“And don’t forget, sir, that Black threatened to fix Henry if he
reported him,” said Belford.</p>

<p>The commander of the <i>Iroquois</i> turned the situation over in his mind.
“Jimmy,” he said, “was there any good reason why Black should have
fallen asleep? Was he worn out, as some of the rest of the crew were, by
their long efforts?”</p>

<p>“He was the freshest man on the boat,” said Belford, with feeling. “He
never left our cabin the whole time we were trying to save our men, and
most of the time I think he was in bed.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded the captain, astonished.</p>

<p>Jimmy hesitated. “I think, sir, he’s yellow.”</p>

<p>“Send him to me,” thundered the captain.</p>

<p>Just what occurred during that interview nobody but the captain and the
delinquent operator ever knew. But young Black came out on deck at last,
looking both frightened and very vengeful, and the captain announced
that Black had been restricted for twenty days. If the third-class radio
man realized how near he had been to a general court-martial, he gave no
sign of knowing, and showed no gratitude for the pleas that had in all
probability saved him.</p>

<p>The run to Boston continued without incident. Slowly but steadily the
<i>Iroquois</i> proceeded with her tow. The wind fell steadily, and the sea
grew calmer. The journey up the tortuous channel was made without
mishap. The <i>Capitol City</i> was safely berthed where she could be
repaired, and the <i>Iroquois</i> continued to the Navy Yard, and secured
some small boats to replace those she had lost overboard. Then the
little cutter once more headed down the harbor and out to the open sea.</p>

<p>The passage back was indeed an eventful one to Henry. Had it not been
for the terrible events he had so recently witnessed, events which he
could not forget, the journey would have been joyful in the extreme. The
weather was excellent. Bright and clear shone the sun: the sea, becoming
ever calmer, flashed and sparkled brilliantly; the air had a tonic
quality. Overhead, white, fleecy clouds floated in an azure sky.</p>

<p>Porpoises appeared. In shoals they played about in the sea. Like so many
hurdlers, they drove forward in groups, first one and then another,
lunging above the waves as though to leap over some unseen marine
obstacle. Henry had never before seen porpoises. It delighted him to
watch them. And when he found that a shoal of them was swimming
immediately in front of the ship’s prow, he leaned over the forward rail
with the sailors, and watched them. In particular he was interested in
two of the great, lumbering bodies that swam side by side immediately
before the cutwater. Their tails almost touched the prow. They looked as
though they were towing the ship, as apparently, without effort, they
kept pace with it. But when a sailor hit one of them with a clinker,
frightening them, the great fish showed that they were anything but
lumbering. They darted away from the Iroquois as though that ship were
tied to a post, instead of traveling fourteen or fifteen miles an hour.
Henry wondered how fast porpoises could swim. He thought that they must
be going at least twice as fast as the cutter. He remembered that he had
read of the enormous speed of those curious denizens of the deep, the
barracuda and the sailfish, which travel sixty or even seventy miles an
hour.</p>

<p>But if the porpoises interested Henry, the next fishes he saw held him
almost speechless, for off the Nantucket shoals the <i>Iroquois</i> came upon
several whales. With the glasses Henry could make them out plainly.
Enormous bulks they were, and at times they spouted columns of water
aloft, which was quickly blown into misty spray by the breeze. Henry had
read of whales spouting, but he had never expected to see one of them
doing it.</p>

<p>Close to the Ambrose Lightship the <i>Iroquois</i> passed as she was heading
into the channel for New York. On the lightship’s flaming red side was
painted in huge letters the word “Ambrose.” Instead of topmasts she
carried, on her mastheads, round red globes for lights at night. Henry
marveled at the sturdiness of these little ships that lie at anchor
month after month, riding out the most terrific storms, and guiding the
sailor on his way.</p>

<p>As the <i>Iroquois</i> sailed past the lightship, the colors of the latter
slowly fluttered down from aloft, then rose again. Henry had not
previously seen one ship salute another by dipping her colors. He
noticed the flag fluttering down, but did not catch the significance of
it until the quartermaster called to a sailor to run aft and dip the
<i>Iroquois’</i> flag. A moment later the cutter’s ensign came fluttering
down, then was run aloft again.</p>

<p>As the <i>Iroquois</i> drew near to New York there was an abundance of work
for Henry to do. He had to be in the wireless house much of the time.
The ship had to report her position at regular intervals. There were
orders to be taken and messages to be sent. Henry felt that his days as
an operator were passing fast. When Mr. Sharp rejoined the boat in New
York, he would of course be relieved from duty. He wanted to learn all
he could about the work of a wireless man on shipboard, so hour after
hour he sat in the wireless shack, sometimes alone at his own watch and
sometimes with his associates.</p>

<p>What was his great joy, on one of these long watches, to hear in the
frosty air the crackling signal “<b>WNA—WNA—WNA</b>—de—<b>WNG</b>.” Well did Henry
know that call. Often had he flashed it out himself. It was the call of
the <i>Lycoming</i>, and her sister ship, the <i>Tioga</i>, was calling her. The
<i>Lycoming</i> must be nearing port. Roy would be at her key. He would be in
New York when Henry got there, perhaps, or at any rate he would reach
there a few hours later. Henry felt that his troubles were over. Roy
would help him out, and maybe could find him a permanent job. At any
rate, Roy had repeatedly asked Henry to make the trip to Galveston and
back as his guest. He would make the trip now. The immediate future was
provided for. With his heart beating with happiness, Henry listened to
the exchange of communications between the <i>Tioga</i> and the <i>Lycoming</i>,
then threw over his switch and rapped out the call,
“<b>WNA—WNA—WNA</b>—de—<b>NTE</b>.”</p>

<p>Promptly came the crackling reply, “<b>NTE—NTE—NTE</b>—de—<b>WNA—K</b>.”</p>

<p>How well Henry recognized the swift, sure, even sending. Nobody else in
the world handled a wireless key just like Roy.</p>

<p>“This is Henry Harper,” flashed back Henry. “I am on the Coast Guard
cutter <i>Iroquois</i>. We are heading for New York. Expect to arrive after
dark tonight. Where can I see you?”</p>

<p>“We dock about sunset,” came the reply. “Come to the <i>Lycoming</i>. Will
wait for you.”</p>

<p>Happy indeed was Henry. A few hours would see him with his old friend.
His troubles would be over. Poor Henry! If only he could have foreseen
what the night would bring forth, his smile would have vanished quickly.
But he could not foresee, and gleefully he continued with his tasks.</p>

<p>As the ship came nearer and nearer to her harbor, Henry had more and
more to do. The captain kept him busy at the wireless. Among other
messages, Henry sent one about the men who had been swept ashore, and
who were now in New York. They were to be at the Staten Island landing
and come aboard the moment the <i>Iroquois</i> dropped anchor. Supper time
came. Henry had been eating with the crew, since he became an operator.
Now the captain asked him to take this last meal on board with him in
the cabin. It was a joyous meal for the lad. He told the captain about
his friend Roy and the good times they had had at home, and about his
coming meeting with him.</p>

<p>After supper, as they sailed up the channel in the dark, Henry started
for the radio house again to relieve Belford. He passed the surgeon, who
was hurrying forward with his medicine case.</p>

<p>“What is the trouble, Doctor?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“One of the sailors mashed a finger while doing something to the
anchor-chain,” replied the surgeon, hurrying on.</p>

<p>Henry entered the radio shack and relieved Belford. The quartermaster
called the latter up to the chart-room. Henry adjusted the headphones
and almost immediately caught the call of the <i>Iroquois</i>. They were
almost at their anchorage, and the call came with startling
distinctness. Henry threw open his switch and flashed an acknowledgment
of the call. The commandant of the New York district of the Coast Guard
was sending a message for Captain Hardwick. Henry wrote it down, copied
it neatly on a telegraph blank, and climbed up the ladder through the
darkness to the bridge.</p>

<p>The ship’s bell was musically striking the hour. It was seven o’clock.
Henry thought he should miss that musical bell after he got ashore.
Captain Hardwick stepped into the chart-room, read the message, and
wrote a reply. Henry hurried back to his post. He had not been gone five
minutes, yet he took the precaution to listen in for a little time. No
one was calling him. He spread the telegraph blank on his desk, read the
captain’s message, and made ready to send it. He threw over his switch,
put his fingers on his key, and started to call headquarters. A few tiny
sparks leaped across his gap. Then his key went dead. Aghast, he dropped
his phones and began to examine his instruments. But he could see
nothing wrong. Everything looked as it had always looked. Again Henry
tried his key. There was no response. His face went white. Apparently
the costly wireless outfit was ruined. It must have been burned out, and
apparently Henry himself was to blame.</p>

</div>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>UNDER A CLOUD</span>
</h2>

<p>For a moment Henry was dumbfounded. He could not imagine what had gone
wrong. Then it occurred to him that perhaps he had a faulty connection
somewhere. He ran his eye and hand over all the lengths of wire in his
outfit, but nowhere could he see anything wrong. More than once he
tested his key, but it did not come to life. Then he thought of his
auxiliary batteries and switched to them. The result was the same.
Everything appeared to be all right, but there was no answering flash
when he pressed the key. He thought of trying to make some new sort of
connection with this secondary battery. The difficulty was that he did
not really know what was wrong. He knew enough about the equipment, he
felt sure, to find the difficulty. He started to make an examination,
but stopped after loosening several screws. It occurred to him that this
might take him a long time. He would not work so surely or so accurately
as a man trained like the chief electrician. Furthermore, he might, in
trying to remedy matters, make them worse.</p>

<p>Henry thought hard for a moment, then decided that the best thing to do
would be to tell the captain at once what had happened. The crippling of
the <i>Iroquois’</i> wireless just at this juncture could make no vital
difference, for the ship was almost ready to drop her anchor, and if the
sailors had got the captain’s message, they would be ready to come
aboard. Doubtless the chief electrician would be with them. He could
probably repair the damage quickly.</p>

<p>The instant he had come to a decision, Henry raced up to the bridge.
“Captain Hardwick,” he reported, “something has gone wrong with the
wireless. I cannot get a spark out of it. I was unable to send your last
message. I do not know what is wrong, and I thought perhaps I had better
not tinker with the instruments, seeing that the chief electrician is
likely so near at hand.”</p>

<p>“Something wrong with the wireless?” echoed the captain, his face
becoming grave. “What have you done to it?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, Captain. I handled it just as I have always handled a
wireless set. When I came up on the bridge a few moments ago it was
working perfectly. When I tried to send your message, the key was dead.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you had a loose connection.”</p>

<p>“I examined the outfit for that, sir.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that you didn’t do something to the instruments? Didn’t
forget about your power? If you allow too much direct current to pass
through your instruments, you will burn them out.”</p>

<p>“I know that, Captain. And I didn’t use too much current. The outfit is
just as it was when Mr. Sharp was in charge.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Mr. Belford?” asked the commander. “Find him.”</p>

<p>Belford was still talking to the quartermaster. They had been on the
bridge, on the sheltered side of the wheelhouse ever since Belford had
left the radio shack.</p>

<p>“Go take a look at the wireless,” directed the commander, “and see if
you can do anything with it.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Black?” demanded the captain, after Belford had run down the
ladder.</p>

<p>The quartermaster and Henry went in search of him. They found him in his
bunk, asleep. It was necessary to shake him roundly before he woke.
Evidently he had been long asleep. He went up to the bridge with them.</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about this difficulty with the wireless?” asked
the captain, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“What difficulty? I’ve been in my bed asleep for an hour, sir. I didn’t
know there was any difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” pressed the captain.</p>

<p>“We found him fast asleep, as he says,” spoke up the quartermaster.</p>

<p>The commander turned slowly to Henry. “The responsibility seems to be up
to you,” he said.</p>

<p>“It seems so, sir,” replied Henry. “Yet that set was all right when I
used it just before I came to the bridge. When I got back and attempted
to send with it again, it went wrong. Certainty I ought to be entitled
to the benefit of the doubt.”</p>

<p>The captain looked at him searchingly. “I didn’t think you were the sort
of boy who would try to crawl out of a difficulty instead of standing up
and facing it,” said the commander.</p>

<p>“Nor am I,” cried Henry. “If I had done the least thing to cause trouble
with the wireless, sir, I would tell you frankly and take the
consequences. But I did nothing—absolutely nothing. I can’t help feeling
that somebody tampered with it.”</p>

<p>“Who would dare do such a thing?” demanded the captain.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I don’t accuse anybody. But I know too much about
wireless outfits to believe that this one suddenly went bad without a
cause.”</p>

<p>“We will investigate the whole matter thoroughly, Henry,” said the
captain. “Pending that investigation, I shall have to ask you to remain
aboard as my guest.”</p>

<p>“I will be glad to do so,” cried Henry. “In fact, I do not want to leave
this boat until we get to the bottom of this whole thing.”</p>

<p>“It may not take so long as you think to do that. The chief electrician
should be aboard in a few moments.”</p>

<p>Already the <i>Iroquois</i> was at her anchorage. Her engines were no longer
running. Against a strong tide she was fast coming to rest.</p>

<p>“Let go your anchor,” said the captain suddenly.</p>

<p>The anchor slid into the water, and the ship swung in the tide and came
to rest. Immediately the launch was lowered. In a moment it was skimming
over to the landing. A few moments more saw it on the way back, laden
heavily with sailors.</p>

<p>The chief electrician was aboard. Like many of the others, he was
suffering from a terrible cold, but he declared he was fit for duty. At
once the captain sent him to the radio shack. Henry and his friend
Belford went with him. Like a finished workman, the head radio man set
about his task of finding the difficulty. He threw on the current and
tested his motor. To all appearances it was in perfect condition. It
operated with perfect smoothness, and the speed was normal and perfectly
sustained, but when Mr. Sharp looked at the voltmeter of his generator,
there was another story to tell. The meter showed no voltage whatever.
There was an open circuit either in the generator or in the field.</p>

<p>At once the chief electrician attempted to adjust the field strength by
shifting the field rheostat. To his surprise he found the handle of the
rheostat was warm.</p>

<p>“The rheostat is burned out,” he said, “and there is likely an open
field circuit.”</p>

<p>“Then one of the field coils must have gone bad,” said Henry.</p>

<p>“Right. I see you do know something about wireless,” observed the chief
electrician.</p>

<p>Henry reached forward and began to examine the field coils. There were
four of them. The bottom one and the two on the sides were warm, but the
top coil was cool.</p>

<p>“Here it is!” cried Henry.</p>

<p>The chief electrician rapidly ran his hand over the coils and verified
Henry’s findings. “We’ll take it off,” he said, “and put a new one in
its place.”</p>

<p>Skillfully he set to work. It required care and deft handling, but he
soon had the defective coil removed and a new one set in its place. Then
he turned to the rheostat, which had been burned out by the excessive
charge sent through it by the defect in the coil. He unclamped the
instrument from the desk, unscrewed the wires from the binding-posts,
and removed the useless thing. He screwed a spare rheostat in place and
connected the wires to the binding-posts. Then he picked up the
offending coil and examined it closely.</p>

<p>“Can’t see a thing wrong with it,” he said. “When I have time, I’ll take
it to pieces and find out what’s wrong with it. Just now I must get the
captain’s messages off.”</p>

<p>He threw the coil in his desk, sat down in the chair, threw over his
switch and touched the key. A great fat stream of fire flashed forth.</p>

<p>“It’s all hunky-dory,” he smiled. “Not so bad as it might have been. Go
tell the captain.”</p>

<p>Henry drew a deep sigh of relief and raced for the captain’s cabin. The
captain said little, but gave him further messages to take to Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>Rapidly the chief radio man flashed out the message that had brought
Henry to grief, and then set to work on the new communications.</p>

<p>When the electrician was done, Henry said to him, “Would it be possible
for Roy to come see me here?”</p>

<p>“Ask the captain.”</p>

<p>The captain considered a moment after Henry had gone again to the cabin
and stated his wish. “I know how you feel,” he said. “You would like to
see your friend. So would I in similar circumstances. It’s pretty late,
but wire him anyway, and ask him to spend the night aboard. You’ve been
a real help to me, and I’ll be glad to have your friend come. Arrange
with him so that we can send a boat ashore to meet him, and tell
Lieutenant Hill when to send it.”</p>

<p>Henry thanked the captain. Elated, he ran to the wireless house and
informed the chief electrician of the captain’s order. Mr. Sharp sat
down at his key, and in no time was in communication with the wireless
man of the <i>Lycoming</i>, who was listening in, in expectation of a call
from Henry. Mr. Sharp told him enough to make him understand that there
was some difficulty about Henry’s leaving the ship, and that the captain
wished him, Roy, to come aboard the <i>Iroquois</i> and spend the night.</p>

<p>Roy came, and was met by a boat. Henry greeted him at the top of the
ladder and wrung his hand. He first introduced Roy to the captain, and
then took him direct to the radio shack. Mr. Sharp was still there.
Henry made the two radio men acquainted, and then the three drew up
their chairs, and Henry related briefly the history of his difficulty.</p>

<p>“May I see that coil?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>The chief electrician drew it out of his drawer and passed it to his
fellow wireless man.</p>

<p>Roy turned the coil slowly around in his hand, examining it searchingly.
It was a coil with a corded covering. Apparently nothing was wrong with
it. There was no external evidence of inner deterioration. When he had
turned it around several times, Roy handed it back to Mr. Sharp.</p>

<p>“It’s odd,” he commented. “I never had a coil burn out for me. But I
suppose there must have been some weak spot in the insulation, and
finally it gave way under the high voltage. Most anything will burn out
in time.”</p>

<p>“When I have opportunity,” said the chief electrician, “I shall take it
to pieces. I’m curious to know how it went bad. If one coil will do
that, another might. I might be caught at sea that way some time and be
in a bad fix.”</p>

<p>“I’d do it without fail,” urged Roy. “You want to find out why that coil
went bad.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to,” assented Mr. Sharp, “for the captain will make a
thorough investigation of the matter.”</p>

<p>They remained in the wireless shack, the two radio men chatting about
their experiences at sea, until young Black came in to take his turn on
watch. He had gone back to his rest after being disturbed by Henry and
Belford. Now Henry and Roy and Mr. Sharp went to the stateroom. Belford
entered with them.</p>

<p>When it came time to go to bed, Belford insisted upon sleeping below
deck with the sailors, so that Henry and Roy might remain together in
the stateroom. Roy was given Belford’s bunk, and Henry took Black’s,
and, slipping into them, they turned out the light. But for some time
Henry could not sleep. He was still excited and worried, and he felt
very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>But finally he quieted down. It gave him such a feeling of comfort to
have Roy at hand. Whatever happened, he knew that he had one staunch
friend who would stand by him to the very end, and who would believe in
him, and who also possessed the technical ability to be of great service
to him. He believed that Mr. Sharp and Belford and the captain were also
friendly to him and would be fair. But he knew that Roy was his friend,
and in that thought he found such solace that presently he fell asleep.
Soon there was no sound in the little stateroom save the heavy breathing
of the sleeping wireless men.</p>

</h2>

<p>The three men in the stateroom were astir early the next morning. Roy
had to get back to the <i>Lycoming</i>, but before he went, he sought and
obtained an interview with Captain Hardwick. The commander liked his
looks, and felt drawn toward him, as indeed every one was, for Roy was a
prime favorite with all who knew him.</p>

<p>“Captain Hardwick,” he said, after Henry had introduced him and
withdrawn from the cabin, “I want first of all to thank you for your
courtesy in allowing me to come to Henry and stay with him overnight. He
feels this matter very keenly, and it is certainly hard to think he
should start out so unfortunately. I suppose the chief electrician has
told you that the difficulty with the wireless was in a coil that had
grounded in the field. He will try to learn why it grounded. But no
matter what he finds, I want to say that you can have absolute
confidence in Henry. I’ve known him a good many years, and he would be
the last person in the world to do anything dishonorable.”</p>

<p>“We will go into this matter thoroughly,” said the captain, without
committing himself, “and I have no doubt we shall get to the bottom of
it. You may be sure that I shall do whatever is right.”</p>

<p>Roy thanked the captain, was set ashore by the launch, and made his way
back to his own ship.</p>

<p>Life aboard the <i>Iroquois</i> went on as it ordinarily did. Now that the
ship lay in harbor, with fewer duties for the seamen, the captain put
the crew to work drilling. Some of these drills Henry had seen the first
day or so he was on board the ship. During the extraordinary events that
had occurred on that trip, drills had been suspended. Now the captain
put his men through their paces with renewed vigor, as though to make up
for lost time.</p>

<p>Naturally the thing that attracted Henry most was the practice with the
big guns. There were two four-inch guns mounted on the forward deck. The
crews of these guns were assembled in their proper places. Then the
captain, standing on the bridge, gave an order, the gun-breeches were
thrown open, the big shells inserted and the breeches locked, the guns
sighted, and, at a word of command, crack they went. But the crack was
only a click, for the shells were imaginary, and all the rest of the
drill was also largely a matter of the imagination. How Henry did wish
he could see the guns really fired at something! What a noise they would
make! And how far their shells would go tearing across the water!</p>

<p>He was especially interested when the captain showed him the
range-finder. Never had he seen anything like this before. It was a
small horizontal tube, containing prisms and reflecting mirrors. There
were eyepieces in the middle of the sides of the tube. When one looked
through this range-finder at a distant ship, or target, that target
seemed to be divided into two parts, half above and half below a common
line. By twirling a screw, and so moving the reflectors within the tube,
the parts of the ship moved into place until at last there stood forth a
perfect image of a ship. Above this image was a scale, which indicated
the range. To find the range, all the commander had to do was to look
through this tube at his target, twirl the screw until the image of the
target became perfect, and then read the figures that stood just above
the image.</p>

<p>The collision drill was also interesting. In imagination, the <i>Iroquois</i>
had run into another ship, and a great gaping hole had been torn in her
hull. At the captain’s word of command the crew sprang to their places,
and a collision mattress was quickly produced and unrolled. This was
then lowered over the side, so as to cover the hole in the hull. In
practice, of course, the collision mattress was not actually lowered
into the water, but it was brought to the side of the ship and balanced
on the rail, ready to be dropped over. It required little vision to see
how useful such an article would be after an actual collision. Unless
the hole in the ship were too large, the mattress would be caught in it
as it was drawn inward by the suction of the inrushing water, much as a
cork might be drawn fast by suction down the neck of a bottle. The
mattress, of course, was meant to act like a cork and keep the sea out.</p>

<p>The abandon-ship drill would have had more fascination for Henry had he
not by this time been so familiar with the process of lowering a small
boat. Nevertheless it was interesting to see the men prepare themselves,
just as they would if they were really going to abandon the ship, with
compasses and rifles, and provisions, and then line up opposite the
boats while the roll was called and each man mustered. Of course the men
did not actually get in the boats, though these were lowered even with
the rail. Likewise this drill gave Henry a chance to examine the small
boats better. Though these were new, they were much like those the
<i>Iroquois</i> had lost. The quartermaster called his attention to the
water-beakers and the boat-boxes that contained certain kinds of food,
fishing-lines, etc. They were so snugly stowed away that Henry had
hardly noticed them. A crew adrift in one of these boats would have food
and water for some time.</p>

<p>The fire drill had little novelty for Henry. Too often he had seen the
firemen in his native town couple their hose to a fire-plug and squirt
water, to be much excited about a similar display now, though it was
rather interesting to see eight streams going at one time.</p>

<p>The infantry drill had more attraction for him. It was not exactly a
novelty, either, but it gave him a new idea of the Coast Guard men. He
had not previously thought of them as soldiers. But when the
quartermaster told him that in time of war the Coast Guard becomes part
of the navy, he saw that marines on a battleship were no more necessary
than they were on a Coast Guard cutter.</p>

<p>Probably Henry would have enjoyed all these exhibitions more, had he not
been under the shadow of suspicion. No formal charges had been made
against him, and he was not exactly a prisoner. Neither was he free to
leave the boat. He hoped that the captain would soon get to the bottom
of the mystery. Henry did not feel free to say anything to the chief
electrician about the matter, lest the latter think that he was seeking
to influence him. So he stayed away from the radio shack. He was no
longer a part of the wireless force, for the return of the chief
electrician had taken his job from him.</p>

<p>But while Henry was disconsolately considering the matter, things were
moving briskly in the wireless shack. Though he was now really sick, the
chief electrician continued on duty. Alone on his watch, he was working
patiently to uncover the difficulty with his grounded coil. Once more he
had examined this coil thoroughly, yet he could see no external
indications of impairment.</p>

<p>Slowly he now unwound the covering cords that formed the outer casing
for the wrapped wires within. There was still nothing visibly wrong. But
when he had cleared the cords away, and had gotten to the coil itself,
his sharp eye detected a shining little dot, hardly bigger than a large
pinhead, among the wire wrappings. With the point of his knife-blade he
picked at this shining point and found it was hard, like metal. He
believed he had found the difficulty.</p>

<p>Getting a large wooden spool, he began to unwind the copper wire from
the coil, rolling it up on the empty spool as he unrolled it from the
coil. Swiftly he transferred the wire from one cylinder to the other. As
his coil grew thinner he saw that he had found the difficulty. The
bright dot was the head of a long, thin finishing nail. Presently it was
sticking up a half inch above the winding of the coil. The chief
electrician started to pull it out, then thought better of it and
desisted. But even his first slight tug at the nail showed him it was
pretty tight. He went on unwinding. But now he examined the wire
carefully as it unrolled. In piercing the coil, the nail had cut the
insulation of practically every wire it had touched. In one or two
places it had even severed the wire wrapping itself. When at last the
chief electrician unwrapped the last winding of the coil, the nail
dropped to his desk. Its end was bent over at an angle, and the metal
core was scratched where the nail had been bent sidewise. The whole
thing was as plain as day now. Some one had driven the nail through the
coil, finishing the job with one or two hard blows that had bent the
point against the core of the coil, sinking the head far below the
corded cover. The question was, who had done it.</p>

<p>As soon as he had made this discovery, Mr. Sharp carefully removed all
traces of his work, locked the parts of the damaged coil in his private
drawer, bundled himself up, and sought the captain. The nail he had in
his pocket.</p>

<p>“I have found the trouble, Captain Hardwick,” the chief electrician
reported, when he was alone with the captain in the cabin. “There it
is,” and he laid the bent nail before his commander.</p>

<p>“You look half sick, Sparks,” said the latter, looking at him keenly.
“Be careful of yourself.”</p>

<p>“It’s that wretched cold I got from my ducking at Cape Cod,” laughed the
chief electrician. “I’ll be all right soon.”</p>

<p>The captain picked up the nail and examined it curiously. “Well?” he
said inquiringly.</p>

<p>“That was in the grounded coil,” said the chief electrician. “That is
what grounded it. Some one drove that nail into the coil.”</p>

<p>The captain stared at the nail long and fixedly. “It beats me,” he said
at last. “You think that it was done maliciously, don’t you? Is there a
possibility that it might have been done in an experimental way? Now,
young Harper is very ambitious and desirous of learning. Might he have
been experimenting, trying to learn something, by fooling with the
outfit?”</p>

<p>“In my opinion, Captain, whoever did this did it with perfect knowledge
of what would happen. I cannot think it was done for any purpose except
to put the wireless out of commission.”</p>

<p>The captain frowned. “I fear you are right, Sparks. But who would want
to put the wireless out of commission? I can think of only two reasons
why any one should do that. Some one might have it in for me or for the
operator. If it weren’t that young Black was asleep when this was done,
I’d think he did it. You know he and Harper had some words.”</p>

<p>“That would explain everything,” said the chief radio man, “but the
facts won’t fit the case.”</p>

<p>“So far as we know, not a soul was on deck except the men on watch. If
some one entered the radio room while Henry was up in the chart room
with me, he would have had to be both sly and slick. He would have had
to watch young Harper’s every movement, and be all prepared to run in
and drive this nail home. It was a terrible risk to run, for it was
certain that the wireless man wouldn’t be away from his key for more
than a minute or two. Discovery was almost certain. The more I consider
it, the more it seems to me that young Harper must have been
experimenting. Did you find anything else out of its usual order?”</p>

<p>“Now that you speak of it, I did find some loose screws, as though some
of the other instruments had been tampered with.”</p>

<p>“I hate to think of it,” replied the captain, “but it looks very much as
though young Harper took advantage of his position to tinker with the
instruments.”</p>

<p>“That might be true about the other instruments, Captain, but he would
certainly know what would result from driving a nail into a field coil.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so, maybe so, but he may not know half as much about wireless as
you think. All I can do is to go according to the facts. They point to
young Harper. But we shall have to have more evidence on the matter
before I decide what to do. Furthermore, the situation is so very
unusual that I am puzzled as to what should be done, even if I knew
Harper to be the culprit. In a sense he was a regular operator. I made
him one temporarily. But he is under age, and we did not have the
consent of his mother to his enlistment. And finally, I should have to
take into consideration the very real service he rendered us during the
storm. Strictly, I suppose, he was only a volunteer that I put in charge
for a time.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help feeling that the lad is innocent,” urged the chief radio
man. “He undoubtedly knows a lot about wireless, and no one who knows
anything about it would have done what he did unless he intended to
cripple the service.”</p>

<p>“We must go by the facts, young man, not by theories,” said the captain
a little testily. “But let’s get all the facts. Say nothing. Let no one
know you have discovered the cause of the trouble. If the culprit thinks
he is undiscovered, he may give himself away.”</p>

</h2>

<p>The day succeeding that on which Mr. Sharp found the nail in the field
coil was another of those cold, stormy days so typical of the fall. The
heavens were gray with threatening clouds. Fitfully the wind moaned and
sobbed, and there was a rawness in the atmosphere that penetrated even
the warmest of woolen clothing. Everything portended the approach of a
storm.</p>

<p>The weather itself was enough to make one gloomy. But Henry, already
worried sadly by the misfortune that had befallen him, was almost sick
with apprehension. If only he could have done something toward
unraveling the mystery that surrounded him, time would have passed more
quickly and not so dismally. But there seemed to be nothing he could do
except wait.</p>

<p>The day’s newspapers, brought aboard with the mail, told of gales raging
farther along the coast, and of storm warnings posted along the entire
Atlantic. Evidently another gale was sweeping the ocean. Terrible as had
been the storm Henry had so recently witnessed, he felt that he would
almost rejoice at an opportunity to go out and face another. Then there
would be a chance to do something, there would be an opportunity for
action.</p>

<p>It seemed to Henry as though he simply could not endure to remain idle.
Naturally he wanted to get to the bottom of the mystery of the field
coil. But what he should do or what he should try to do he could not
even imagine. To talk about the matter was useless. That would get him
nowhere and advertise something that was known only to a few.
Furthermore the captain himself was continuing his investigations, and
had given strict orders not to talk about the affair.</p>

<p>When Henry chanced to pass the stateroom of the wireless operators, he
thought he would stop and inquire how Mr. Sharp was. The latter had
quite evidently been sick the preceding day, though he stuck to his
post. Henry knocked at the door. A feeble voice invited him to come in.
Henry entered, and found the chief electrician alone. Belford was on
watch. Henry did not know where Black was. It did not matter. He saw at
once that Mr. Sharp was very sick. His cheeks were flushed. Henry
stepped to the bunk and laid his hand on the man’s forehead. It was dry
and very hot, and his eyes had that burned-out, almost plaintive look,
that fever sufferers sometimes have.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Sharp,” said Henry, “you’re sick; you’re real sick. You must
have a high fever.”</p>

<p>“I guess that I am about all in,” agreed the chief electrician. “I’ve
been taking some dope that the doctor gave me for this cold, and I
thought that I could throw it off, but I guess it’s got me.”</p>

<p>“Have you reported sick to the doctor?”</p>

<p>“No. I thought a while ago that I had better do so, but there wasn’t any
one here to take a message, and I felt so rocky I just hadn’t gumption
enough to get up and go to the doctor myself.”</p>

<p>“Let me call the doctor for you,” urged Henry.</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll be obliged to you.”</p>

<p>Delighted to find something to do, Henry stepped from the room and
hurried aft to the wardroom. There he found the doctor, who came at
once. When the latter had taken Mr. Sharp’s temperature and examined him
otherwise, he said: “Sparks, it’s you for the sick bay, quick. What do
you mean by lying here half dead and not sending for help?”</p>

<p>“You can’t put me in any sick bay,” protested the chief electrician
weakly. “I’ve got to go on duty shortly.”</p>

<p>At that the doctor exploded. “Humph!” he snorted. “Duty! Yes, on a white
cot! You’ll be lucky if you see the radio room again in a fortnight.”</p>

<p>Henry saw his chance. “Let me take your turns at the key, Mr. Sharp,” he
begged. “I promise you nothing more shall happen to the instruments when
I am on watch. I’ll never leave the room for a second, after this.”</p>

<p>When the chief electrician seemed to hesitate, Henry continued his
pleading. “Mr. Sharp, you don’t believe that I had anything to do with
damaging that coil, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” said the chief electrician decisively. “And I’m
perfectly willing to have you go back on duty, but I don’t know what the
skipper will think about it.”</p>

<p>“Will you ask him if I may go back on duty?” begged Henry.</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Mr. Sharp weakly.</p>

<p>Henry fairly raced for the captain’s cabin and told the commander that
Mr. Sharp was sick and would like to speak to him. Captain Hardwick at
once went forward. Henry stepped outside the stateroom and the captain
conferred with the chief electrician. The result of that talk was that
Mr. Sharp, who was now suffering from pneumonia, went to the sick bay
and Henry again went on duty in the wireless house.</p>

<p>The very first message he caught was an order from headquarters for the
<i>Iroquois</i> to proceed to sea at once and take the oil tanker <i>Rayolite</i>
in tow. Henry was going to have his desire fulfilled. The cutter was to
go out and once more wrestle with the ocean. The <i>Rayolite</i>, an
unfinished tanker, was being towed from Nova Scotia to New York. In the
storm the towing tug had deserted her, and the ship was somewhere out on
the ocean, driving helplessly before the wind. Her position was given in
the despatch as approximately forty-one north, seventy-one west. There
were some maps in the wireless shack, so after he had sent the message
to the imperiled tanker Henry looked up her position. It seemed to be
almost due east of the eastern end of Long Island. The wind was east of
north, so that the helpless tanker would be blown along almost parallel
with the coast line. Henry was glad of that. He did not want to see any
more ships piled up on the shore.</p>

<p>Within a very few minutes after the receipt of this message, the
<i>Iroquois</i> was once more heading out to sea. Clad in thick woolen
garments and oilskins, the captain stood on the bridge, conning the
cutter through the channel. He was needed there. The passage, so fair
and easy on a clear day, now called for the utmost caution. Lowering
clouds of fog were driving in from the sea, increasing in density with
every minute. Snow had begun to fall, at first coming in gusty squalls.
Then it fell steadily, the dancing flakes driven in swirling clouds
before the sweeping winds. At times the snow changed to rain, and was
flung in blinding sheets against the little cutter.</p>

<p>Cautiously the <i>Iroquois</i> nosed her way down the channel, the water
becoming rougher and rougher as she approached the open sea. Looking
into the swirling, blinding curtain of fog and snow, Henry did not see
how the captain could possibly find his way. But with chart and compass
to direct him, and his wonderful seaman’s sense of direction to aid him,
he took the cutter from buoy to buoy, along the channel, straight out
again to the Ambrose Lightship.</p>

<p>With the open sea before him, the captain now confidently set the cutter
upon the course he had plotted to reach, a point to leeward of the
position forty-one north, seventy-one west, whither the <i>Rayolite</i> would
likely have drifted. All the while wind and sea were making up, more and
more tumultuously. In the wireless shack Henry tried again and again to
reach the <i>Rayolite</i>. No one on board knew whether the unfinished tanker
was equipped with wireless, but hour after hour, at intervals, Henry
persisted in his attempt to get word from the helpless vessel. As the
<i>Iroquois</i> continued on her way, the wind began to shift to the east, a
fact that Henry noted with apprehension. He had seen all that he wanted
to see of raging storms that blew directly toward the shore. Regardless
of wind and wave, the <i>Iroquois</i> drove on through the storm, hour after
hour, until at last, as nearly as the commander could tell by dead
reckoning, the cutter had attained the desired point to leeward of the
position forty-one north, seventy-one west.</p>

<p>Long ago night had fallen. Again and again Henry had swept the stormy
skies with the wireless, seeking to get some answering vibration from
the <i>Rayolite</i>, but always his efforts had been futile. Now, as the
cutter rolled in the seas, at the point where the captain had figured
the <i>Rayolite</i> ought to be, there was neither light nor sound to suggest
the presence of another ship. Tumultuous waves and driving curtains of
fog and snow shut in the <i>Iroquois</i>. Again and again Henry combed the
atmosphere with his flashing signals, but no answering sound returned
through the night. Henry could not see how it would be humanly possible
to find a ship under such circumstances in such a welter of raging
water.</p>

<p>But nothing seemed to dismay Captain Hardwick. When he had swept the
seas with his searchlight, and blown his siren again and again, without
getting any response, he methodically set about finding the lost tanker,
making a grid as he had done when searching for the derelict. All night
long the cutter followed the pattern of the grid, and all night long the
storm grew worse, and wind and sea made up more furiously than ever. The
captain was very careful to lay his course so that mostly he was either
bucking the heavy seas or running before them.</p>

<p>Dawn brought no cessation of the storm. With undiminished fury it lashed
the sea and clutched at the staunch little cutter. Nor was there any
sign of the lost <i>Rayolite</i>, until young Black, standing his watch in
the radio shack, caught a very faint call for help. He magnified the
sound to the maximum, but was able to get nothing more. At once Henry
was summoned. He threw over his switch and flashed out an answering
call, asking for the vessel’s name and position. His message carried
true, for almost immediately came a hardly audible answer. The message
was from the lost tanker. She did not know her position. She had sixteen
men aboard, with no machinery, no ballast, and forty feet of freeboard.
There was little food and almost no water left. She had a small radio
set, operated by a small storage battery, that might carry fifty miles
at most. She was wallowing fearfully and driving helpless before the
storm.</p>

<p>Henry remained on watch while Black took the message to the captain.
“Try to get a bearing with the radio compass,” ordered the captain.</p>

<p>Black hurried to rejoin Henry. “Tell the <i>Rayolite</i> we want to get a
compass bearing,” said Black.</p>

<p>Henry turned to his key and flashed the call of the <i>Rayolite</i>. Hardly
audible was the acknowledgment. “<i>Iroquois</i> wants compass bearing,”
telegraphed Henry. “Flash letters MO continuously several minutes. Stand
by for answer.”</p>

<p>“Will flash let——” came the reply, so faint that Henry hardly caught the
signals. The end of the message was lost altogether.</p>

<p>“She’s gone,” said Henry, aghast. Then he added: “Maybe she’s only gone
out of hearing. We must be heading away from her. Tell the captain.”</p>

<p>Black rushed for the captain. Henry turned to his key. Again and again
he flashed out the call of the <i>Rayolite</i>, but no answering signal came
through the storm. Without turning from his instruments he knew that the
<i>Iroquois</i> was changing her course. She began to roll fearfully in the
trough of the sea. Henry had to cling to his desk to keep from sliding
out of his chair. Once such rolling of the ship would have filled him
with terror. Now he thought little of it. He was too intent on what he
was doing.</p>

<p>For a long time they drove on through the storm. Belford relieved Black
in the wireless shack. Suddenly Henry became aware that something
unusual was happening. Again he sensed the fact that the ship was
turning, but this time he knew that it was different. Now the motion of
the cutter was terrifying. At times she was almost on her beams’ ends.
Henry peered out through the windows. He noticed that life-lines had
been run along the deck, to grip when passing. He had not realized how
truly awful the sea had become. When he glanced over the side of the
ship, his heart fairly stood still. They were almost in the breakers.
Evidently the captain had been wrong in his reckoning. The cutter had
almost piled up on the shoals. She was coming about, very, very slowly.
Now Henry understood why she rolled so terribly. He clung to his desk
and watched the sea and the boiling breakers in silence, fascinated,
almost paralyzed with horror. Was the <i>Iroquois</i> going to be where the
<i>Capitol City</i> had so recently been?</p>

<p>At last the ship was headed about, bow to the sea, but the waves had
drifted her so close to the surf that every second Henry expected to
feel the ship jar and pound on the sands. In the pilot house the captain
stood with nerve of iron, though his cheeks had gone white, directing
every movement of the <i>Iroquois</i>. The instant she was nose to the sea,
he signaled for full speed ahead. The cutter drove forward, and a huge
wave, sweeping completely over her bow, tore aft along her deck,
smashing and rending. The two small boats were snatched bodily from
their davits and hurled far astern into the raging sea. A third was torn
loose, and hung by its after-fall, swinging back and forth with the
motion of the <i>Iroquois</i>, like a monster pendulum, pounding the ship’s
rail to pieces.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Henry. “That boat will batter a hole in the side of the
ship. I must tell the captain.”</p>

<p>He dashed out of the radio house, leaving Belford on watch. Before Henry
had taken two steps he realized how reckless he had been to jump out on
the deck so thoughtlessly. He could not stand erect without support.
Wildly he clutched for a life-line, caught it, and started for the
bridge. But the captain was well aware of what had happened. Already he
was making preparations to cut away the swinging boat. Sailors were
issuing on deck with axes. The captain himself came down from the
bridge.</p>

<p>“Stand back,” roared the commander. “That boat’s liable to tear loose
and kill somebody.”</p>

<p>Quickly a rope was tied about the body of a sailor, and cautiously he
approached the swinging boat. Watching his opportunity, he swung his axe
against the fall, severing it. The lifeboat dropped outboard like a
plummet. An upshooting wave lifted it and flung it aft. The sailors
turned to seek shelter. A cross comber broke over the side of the ship,
drenching everybody. Henry alone was not in oilskins. He was soaked to
the skin. Quick as thought he darted to the stateroom and grabbed up a
dry jacket. He didn’t know whose it was. Back in the radio shack, he
drew off his own dripping coat and slipped on the borrowed garment. In
the warm radio shack he knew he would soon dry out.</p>

<p>Steadily the <i>Iroquois</i> headed into the wind. That outlying shoal that
had all but caught the <i>Iroquois</i> was the eastern tip of Long Island.
Well enough the captain knew that, and now he corrected his course.
Somewhere to the southeast of this point the <i>Rayolite</i> would likely be.</p>

<p>When he had worked far enough offshore, the captain changed his course
again, heading west of south. All the while Henry was trying, from time
to time, to pick up the <i>Rayolite</i> again with the wireless. For a long
time he got no answer to his messages. Then came an almost inaudible
reply. The <i>Rayolite</i> could hear the <i>Iroquois</i> plainly and had answered
all her calls. Once more Henry instructed the <i>Rayolite</i> to sound the
letters MO while the <i>Iroquois</i> tried to get a compass bearing. While
Henry sat at his key, Belford made his way to the radio compass room.
This was a little, squarish structure amidships. Inside, the roof was
lined with copper screening so that the body of the operator would not
influence the inductance and affect the compass. The radio compass
itself, a great wrapping of wire on a rectangular frame, like the four
sides of a rectangular box, was mounted on a vertical metal rod, so it
could be twirled round in a circle. Encircling the revolving vertical
shaft was a circular plate, not unlike the steering wheel of a
motor-car, upon which were marked the three hundred and sixty degrees of
a circle. The compass was at zero when its windings or wire-wrapped
sides were parallel with the ship. As the compass was revolved, the
listening operator would hear, with varying degrees of loudness, the
signal he was watching for. Now he heard the sound with maximum
distinctness. Again it grew faint, and, as he twisted the compass
farther around the circle, the signal once more reached its loudest
pitch. The two maximum sound points the operator noted on the
degree-marked circular plate. Halfway between these two maximum points,
or at the point of minimum distinctness, was the desired bearing, the
point whence came the desired signal. A zero bearing meant that the
signal came from either dead ahead or astern.</p>

<p>Now young Belford carefully closed the door of the compass shack,
adjusted the headphones, and slowly revolved the radio compass. Very
indistinct was the signal from the <i>Rayolite</i>. Again and again the young
operator revolved his compass, uncertain when the sound came loudest, so
faint was it at all times. But finally he decided upon a bearing, and
through the speaking tube called up this bearing to the quartermaster on
the monkey bridge. A true compass was located on the monkey bridge. The
compass in the radio shack deviated from this, so that it was necessary
to correct young Belford’s bearing. This the quartermaster did, and
conveyed the resulting information to the captain. There was a deviation
table in the radio shack that Belford could have consulted, but he had
had little experience with the radio compass.</p>

<p>Now the <i>Iroquois</i> was headed straight in the direction indicated by the
radio compass. Every fifteen minutes Henry flashed out the call of the
<i>Rayolite</i> and got a reply. For some time these replies grew constantly
stronger, and then became fainter, yet the ship signaled that she could
hear the <i>Iroquois</i> with increasing distinctness. It was evident that
the tanker’s wireless was failing.</p>

<p>Henry went up to the bridge and told the captain. The captain considered
a moment, and Henry looked about while he waited. The storm had abated
not a particle. The view was still veiled by shifting, swirling curtains
of snow, but the fog had lifted. The waves were tremendous, but as the
<i>Iroquois</i> was no longer bucking them, they did not seem so terrifying.
Yet the sea was appalling enough to one so little accustomed to it as
Henry was.</p>

<p>Suddenly the captain spoke. “Henry,” he directed, “tell the <i>Rayolite</i>
that her signals are getting weaker, and that her battery is evidently
going bad. Tell her to save her battery. I’m going to fire a gun every
twenty minutes. Tell her to indicate whether or not she hears it. A
single word will answer.”</p>

<p>Henry returned to the radio shack and flashed the message to the tanker.
A moment later there was a terrific explosion that made him fairly jump
in his chair. He began to make the sparks fly under his key. “<i>Iroquois</i>
just fired gun,” he flashed. “Did you hear?”</p>

<p>A long pause followed. Then came the faint reply, “No.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later another shot was fired. Once more Henry called the
<i>Rayolite</i> and asked if she had heard it. And again came the answer,
“No.”</p>

<p>Three times every hour the <i>Iroquois</i> fired a shot, but for a long time
the sound of the reports did not reach the struggling ship. Meantime the
day was passing fast. Late afternoon came, and still the <i>Iroquois</i> had
not found the helpless tanker. But as dusk was descending there came the
joyful word from the <i>Rayolite</i>, “Heard your shot faintly.”</p>

<p>Again the captain called for a compass bearing. This time the signals
from the tanker came much more distinctly, and the captain accordingly
altered his course. The first faint call had given Belford a bearing not
quite correct. The <i>Iroquois</i> continued to fire her gun. Forty minutes
after the course was changed the <i>Rayolite</i> reported that she heard the
shot from the <i>Iroquois</i> clearly.</p>

<p>When Henry sought the bridge with this cheering news, the commander
said, “Tell the <i>Rayolite</i> operator to set his watch with yours. At five
o’clock I will fire another shot. At the same instant you are to notify
him by wireless. Tell him to note how many seconds elapse between the
time he gets your flash and the time he hears my gun.”</p>

<p>Once more Henry called the <i>Rayolite</i> and explained the captain’s plan.
“At five exactly we will fire,” concluded Henry.</p>

<p>Five o’clock came. Henry sat at his desk, switch thrown over, finger on
his key. “Bang!” crashed the gun. Flash, went Henry’s signal. Then he
sat in silence, waiting almost breathlessly for the reply. Five, ten,
fifteen seconds elapsed. Half a minute went by. There was no reply.
Another half minute passed and the wireless was silent. Henry looked
worried.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose her wireless has failed altogether?” he asked Belford.
Before the latter could answer, Henry’s headphones began to speak.
“Sixty-five seconds difference,” came the reply, both brief and faint.</p>

<p>When the captain received the news he did a little figuring. “Thirteen
miles distant,” he commented. “We ought to be up with her in a couple of
hours.”</p>

<p>The two hours passed, and no ship was visible. Still the storm raged
without abatement. Night had come. For two days and a night the
<i>Iroquois</i> had been searching the stormy sea for this tanker that seemed
to evade her so persistently. She ought to be at hand, but nowhere could
she be seen. Through the blinding storm came no sign of the fugitive
vessel. No shaft of light pierced the swirling curtain of snow and mist.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there was the <i>Rayolite</i>, almost abreast of them, not more
than three hundred yards distant. It was impossible to send a line to
her. No small boat could live in such a sea. It was doubtful if a shot
would carry true. The captain swung the <i>Iroquois</i> directly to windward
of the tanker, and cut down his speed almost to nothing. In a moment the
huge ship was almost out of sight. With her tremendous freeboard, she
drove before the gale almost as fast as the <i>Iroquois</i> could steam. The
captain turned his searchlight directly on the vanishing tanker,
signaled for more speed, and drove straight at her. And all night long
the <i>Iroquois</i> steamed directly at the <i>Rayolite</i>, which drove furiously
ahead, under the pressure of the gale. The captain left the bridge and
threw himself on the cushioned seats in his cabin, to snatch some sleep.
Henry, who had spent long, long hours on duty, made his way to the
operators’ cabin and lay down, fully dressed, in Black’s bed. The latter
and Belford were to watch through the night, with Henry subject to call,
if messages had to be sent. He was so worn out that he did not even
remove his coat, the jacket he had snatched from the wardrobe after his
wetting.</p>

<p>Daylight saw no cessation of the wind, though the snow had ceased to
fall, and no longer was the face of the deep clouded with mist. When the
captain came on deck again, after a few hours’ rest, he pushed the
cutter straight at the <i>Rayolite</i> until she was close behind her.
Meantime he had sent a wireless to the tanker, telling her to watch for
a line. Now the little brass gun was brought to the cutter’s forward
rail, and that sturdy little craft was pushed still nearer the tanker,
which was driving ahead, broadside to. At a favorable moment the shot
was fired, the slender shot-line went hurtling squarely over the centre
of the huge tanker, and the men on her seized it and began to draw it
home. A heavier line was bent to it, and soon the end of this had been
pulled aboard the <i>Rayolite</i>. Meantime a heavy towing hawser had been
passed out through a stern chock of the <i>Iroquois</i>, and the bight of it
brought forward, outside of the rail, where it was stopped up or tied
with little stops or small ropes. This was to keep the hawser from
fouling the propeller, when the cutter should swing around, stern to her
tow. Then the hawser was rove round the cutter’s forward bitts. Through
Henry the commander now sent a message to the <i>Rayolite</i>.</p>

<p>“Take hawser in through your forward chock and make it fast around your
foremast,” telegraphed Henry.</p>

<p>The men on the <i>Rayolite</i> bent to their task and soon pulled the great
hawser aboard. They made it fast to the mast.</p>

<p>“Everything ready,” came the message to Henry from the <i>Rayolite</i>.</p>

<p>The captain signaled for more speed. The <i>Iroquois</i> was pushed ahead to
get slack. Then the bight of the hawser was cast off the bitts, and the
speed of the cutter lessened. Gradually the hawser grew taut. It
stretched as tight as a fiddlestring. Then slowly the giant tanker,
pressed by the wind, began to turn. The hawser, led through her forward
chock, held her bow fast. The wind drove her stern round until she was
head to the <i>Iroquois</i>. In another moment the <i>Iroquois</i> herself began
to swing. With a startling snap one of the slender stops that held the
hawser to the rail parted. Another broke under the strain. The cutter
swung further around. One stop after another parted. Finally the
<i>Iroquois</i> lay stern to her tow, the hawser taut between them, with no
danger of its fouling the propeller.</p>

<p>In turning, the little cutter lay for a moment in the trough of the sea.
She rolled alarmingly. At her first pitch Henry’s chair went sliding
across the floor, and pads and pencils flew from the desk. At the same
instant a message from the <i>Rayolite</i> began to sound in the lad’s ear.
He could not reach his fallen pencils. Instinctively he reached in the
pocket of the jacket he was wearing. He found a mass of trash and drew
it forth, hoping to find a pencil. There were strings, matches,
cigarette papers, bits of chalk, and other articles. Among the mass
shone two slender little cylinders of metal that made Henry’s heart
fairly stop beating. They were two slender finishing nails.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XVIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A CLUE TO THE CULPRIT</span>
</h2>

<p>With the call of the <i>Rayolite</i> sounding in his ears, Henry had to leave
the nails for later consideration. He swept all the mass of stuff back
into his pocket and turned to his key. When he had taken the message, he
sent it up to the captain by a sailor. That done, he stripped off the
coat and searched it thoroughly. But nothing else of interest was to be
found. The coat was one of those dark blue sailor jackets. There were
dozens exactly like it on the <i>Iroquois</i>. No name or identifying
initials could be found in it. Henry was not really sure whose coat it
was. Both Black and Belford had been wearing heavy sweaters. The coat
might belong to either. It might even be Mr. Sharp’s coat. Henry had
grabbed it out of the wardrobe when his own had got wet, with little
thought as to who owned it.</p>

<p>Presently Belford came on duty. “I’m much obliged for the loan of your
coat,” said Henry. “I grabbed it and pulled it on yesterday after I got
wet, without stopping to ask your permission.”</p>

<p>Belford looked at the coat a moment, then looked inside. “It’s not my
coat,” he observed. “I have my initials sewed in mine. But you’d be
welcome to it if it were mine.”</p>

<p>Henry drew a deep sigh of relief. “So it’s not yours, eh? Then whose is
it?”</p>

<p>“That’s Black’s, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll get a breath of fresh air,” said Henry.</p>

<p>“That won’t be difficult. It’s blowing a streak, but nothing like it did
yesterday.”</p>

<p>Henry left the radio shack and made his way to the bridge. “Captain
Hardwick,” he said, “when you find it convenient, I’d like to talk to
you privately.”</p>

<p>The captain looked at Henry sharply. “Come to my cabin at noon,” he
said.</p>

<p>All the morning long the commander remained at his post on the bridge.
The storm was easing up, but the high seas made the towing of the
<i>Rayolite</i> difficult. Too much strain on the towing hawser would cause
it to part. With too little tension, the <i>Rayolite</i> was harder to
handle. The captain, with his long experience, knew that he dare not
relax his vigilance for a moment, but when mess gear was piped, he
turned the control of the cutter over to Lieutenant Hill with a few
words of caution, and made his way to his cabin.</p>

<p>Impatiently Henry had been waiting for this move, and hardly had Captain
Hardwick reached his quarters before the lad was knocking at his door.</p>

<p>“Well, Henry,” smiled the commander as the young wireless operator
entered the cabin, “what can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“Do you see this jacket?” asked Henry, with feverish eagerness, pulling
off the garment in question. “When I got wet yesterday while that small
boat was being cut loose, I ran into the stateroom and grabbed this coat
out of the wardrobe. I put it on in place of my own wet one. This
morning I got to feeling around in the pocket in search of a pencil and
this is what I found.”</p>

<p>From the pocket Henry drew out the entire mass of rubbish and dumped it
on the captain’s table. Then he sorted out the two finishing nails and
handed them to the captain. “They looked to me exactly like the nail Mr.
Sharp found in the damaged field coil,” explained Henry.</p>

<p>The commander examined the nails with interest. Unlocking a drawer in
his desk, he drew out the nail Mr. Sharp had given him and laid it
beside the others. The three were identical, though of course the one
was bent.</p>

<p>“Whose coat is that?” demanded Captain Hardwick.</p>

<p>“I can’t say for sure, sir, but I think it’s Black’s. Belford says it
is.”</p>

<p>“I thought I gave orders not to say anything about this matter,” said
the captain severely, an angry frown wrinkling his forehead.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been talking about it. I merely asked Mr. Belford if the coat
was his. I didn’t tell him about the nails.”</p>

<p>“Who was with you when you found the nails?”</p>

<p>“Nobody, sir.”</p>

<p>“Nobody! Then how do I know that you really found them in the coat? What
was to prevent you from putting them in the coat yourself and then
bringing it to me, to throw suspicion on Black?”</p>

<p>Poor Henry! For a moment he looked heartbroken. Then he became
indignant. “Captain Hardwick,” he cried, “do you think I would do a
trick like that?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter what I think,” replied the commander. “The fact that
you found two finishing nails in Black’s coat doesn’t prove anything.
There may be a dozen other coats on this ship with similar nails in
them. Don’t you see that it is one thing to assert something and quite
another to prove it? This is likely Black’s coat, though you haven’t
proved even that. But it doesn’t follow that Black put the nails in his
coat. Somebody else may have done it, even if you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Captain Hardwick,” protested Henry, “don’t you trust me at all?”</p>

<p>The captain smiled. “It isn’t a matter of trust, Henry. You come to me
with something you regard as evidence against Black. I’m glad to have
any evidence in the matter that is evidence, but we must be sure that it
is, before we use it. Don’t you understand what I am driving at?”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Henry, drawing a breath of relief. “The finding of these
nails isn’t proof of anything. I grasp that all right. But
it’s—suggestive.”</p>

<p>“Now you are on exactly the right tack. It’s very suggestive. You think
that I’ve been a little hard on you, Henry. I want to be fair. Now I’ll
say that I think it much more likely that Black would have had nails in
his coat than that you would have had them about you. Boys dressed to go
visiting don’t ordinarily carry nails with them.”</p>

<p>Henry’s face evidently showed the relief he felt. The captain smiled
again. “It was quite right for you to bring me this coat,” he continued.
“I shall follow up this suggestion. Meantime I want you to go on about
your work and say nothing about the matter.”</p>

<p>Henry thanked the commander and withdrew from the cabin. Hardly had he
left before the captain punched his call-bell and sent Rollin to summon
the quartermaster. The latter was the captain’s prime favorite and
right-hand man among the non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>“Quartermaster,” said the commander when his helper appeared,
“immediately after I go back to the bridge, I want you to slip into the
wireless stateroom without being observed, and search the place. Keep
your eyes open, especially for nails like this,” and the commander held
out the two nails Henry had given him. “Look in all the nooks and
corners, the bunks, and elsewhere, and notice anything out of the
ordinary that you find. Above all, as you value your job, don’t say a
word about this to any one.”</p>

<p>When Captain Hardwick passed to the bridge, he poked his head into the
radio shack. “Belford,” he said, “I want you in the chart-room. And I
want you, Black, to stick close to your instruments. Don’t leave them
for a second. The <i>Rayolite</i> may be signaling us at any time, and it’s
important to catch her message instantly. The hawser is likely to part
at any moment if we aren’t careful. Harper is to stand watch with you.”</p>

<p>Belford followed his commander up to the chart-room, where he was put to
work erasing lines from some old charts. The quartermaster promptly
seized his opportunity to slip into the stateroom, where he locked the
door, hung a cloth over the window, and got to work. For more than an
hour he searched everywhere and found nothing out of the way. But when
he got to work in the bunks, he found, tucked securely away under the
top mattress, a peculiar little hammer. He put the room to rights again,
uncovered the window-pane, picked up the hammer, and, concealing it in
the palm of his hand, stepped out on deck.</p>

<p>He found himself face to face with the ship’s carpenter. A sudden lurch
of the ship threw them together. Laughing, each grasped the other. As
well as he could the quartermaster kept his fingers closed over the
hammer-head, but the quick eyes of the carpenter saw the protruding ends
of it.</p>

<p>“So you’re the fellow who borrowed that, are you?” he said. “I’ve been
hunting all over for that hammer. Why didn’t you tell me you had
borrowed it?”</p>

<p>For a moment the quartermaster was at a loss. He knew not what to say.
Then he asked the carpenter to come with him to the captain.</p>

<p>“Captain,” said the quartermaster, when they had mounted to the bridge,
“I have some things I would like to tell you. The carpenter here can
help explain them.”</p>

<p>The captain stepped to the chart-room and dismissed Belford, who at once
departed. Then the captain, the quartermaster, and the carpenter stepped
into the chart-room and closed the doors.</p>

<p>“I found this hammer under the mattress of the top bunk in the wireless
men’s room,” explained the quartermaster. “Black sleeps in that bunk. As
I came out on deck I bumped into the carpenter, here. I thought that I
had the hammer concealed, but he caught sight of it in my closed fist.
It seems he has been looking for this very hammer for some days. It
belongs in his tool kit.”</p>

<p>“When and how did you lose your hammer?” asked the commander.</p>

<p>“I was using it last Thursday. When evening mess gear was piped, I had
not quite finished the job I was doing, and I left it lying with my work
while I ate my supper. When I went back to finish the job, the hammer
was missing.”</p>

<p>“Where were you at work?”</p>

<p>“Close to the stairway where the men come down from deck, sir. I pushed
my work to one side, where it would not be in the way, and stepped to
the table. I wasn’t away from it half an hour.”</p>

<p>“The hammer was where any one could get it easily, was it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It was just beside the stairway. Any one going up or down the
stairs could have seen it, and it was necessary to take only a step to
one side of the stairway to reach it. Any one going up the steps from
supper could have picked it up easily without being noticed.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing with the hammer?”</p>

<p>“I was making a case for the executive officer, sir. He wanted a case
with pigeonholes to hold some of his account books.”</p>

<p>“Then you were using small nails to fasten in the partitions with, I
take it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, some long, thin, finishing nails. They were like these, sir.”
And the carpenter thrust his hand into his pocket, drew forth an
assortment of nails, and fished out a finishing nail that was the
duplicate of those Henry had so recently found.</p>

<p>“Give it to me,” directed the captain.</p>

<p>“It looks to me,” continued the commander, after the carpenter had
handed him the nail, “as though some one coming up to the deck after
eating must have picked up your hammer and perhaps some nails with it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say about the nails,—they were scattered about on the case,—but
there is no doubt some one got the hammer.”</p>

<p>“It looks as though young Black got it,” said the quartermaster.</p>

<p>The captain dismissed the two men. “I don’t want a word said about
this,” he warned them. “Be very careful that you do not mention it to
any one.”</p>

<p>The moment he was alone the captain turned to a calendar. “Last
Thursday,” he muttered to himself, “was the day we got back to New York
from Boston. Henry was on duty in the wireless house every minute that
evening. I don’t know that he even got any supper. I must find out what
Black was doing at that hour. I guess the best way to do it is through
the quartermaster.”</p>

<p>Again the quartermaster was called and instructed to find out from the
third-class wireless man, without arousing the latter’s suspicions, at
what time he ate his supper on the preceding Thursday evening. That was
not a difficult thing to do. Later in the day the quartermaster engaged
young Black in conversation and turned the talk to the events of their
run from Boston.</p>

<p>“You missed your supper the night we got in, didn’t you?” asked the
quartermaster.</p>

<p>“Not on your life,” said Black. “You don’t catch me missing anything
like that. I was one of the first fellows at the table.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet I’ll be one of the first there this noon,” said the
quartermaster. “I’m hungry enough to eat a bear.”</p>

<p>He said good-bye to Black and reported to Captain Hardwick. When the
commander was alone, he said to himself: “The trail grows warm. Black
went to supper at the first pipe of the whistle. He likely finished
before the others, and went out. Nails and hammer lay invitingly beside
the stairway. Unobserved, he snatched up the hammer and some nails, and
thrust them into his coat. A little later a nail of that same kind got
into the wireless outfit. Later still, nails and hammer are found in
Black’s possession, or, what amounts to the same thing.”</p>

<p>The captain frowned. “But Black was asleep when that nail got into the
wireless,” he commented. He pondered a moment. “By George! I wonder if
he <i>was</i> asleep,” he exclaimed. “Everything hinges on that. How am I
going to find out?”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XIX</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE CULPRIT DISCOVERED</span>
</h2>

<p>Night had come before the captain left the bridge. As he paced back and
forth he turned over in his mind the problem of the finishing nail.
Black could not have driven the nail into the field coil if he was
really asleep at the time he was believed to have been. Was Black asleep
or not? How was he ever to discover? Again and again the commander of
the <i>Iroquois</i> asked himself that question, as he moved about the
bridge. He could see no way to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Gradually the wind fell, and with its fall the sea grew less violent.
The cloud rack thinned. Vigilantly the captain watched the sky. Finally
what he was looking for appeared. The clouds parted for a space,
revealing the purple vault of heaven, studded with shining stars.
Quickly he seized his instruments and ascertained his position. Now he
knew exactly where the <i>Iroquois</i> was. The position of the cutter was
but little different from that in which his dead reckoning put her. The
captain rectified his position on the chart, and then, vastly relieved,
he turned the cutter over to Lieutenant Hill and went to his cabin. The
<i>Rayolite</i> was towing securely, wind and sea were growing calmer with
every hour, and the cutter’s position was known exactly. He had done a
hard job and done it well. No wonder the commander was gratified.</p>

<p>If only he could handle the other problem as satisfactorily. But how?
That was the question he asked himself over and over. Rollin brought the
commander food. When he had eaten, Captain Hardwick got out the three
finishing nails. He sat looking at them for a while, his brow wrinkled
in deep thought. “If Sparks is fit to be seen,” he said to himself, “I
ought to show him these. He might be able to suggest some course of
action that would help.”</p>

<p>Captain Hardwick arose and went forward to the sick bay. He met the
surgeon at the door. “How’s Mr. Sharp?” asked the commander.</p>

<p>“He’s pretty sick, Captain, but I think he’ll pull through all right.
He’s got a fine constitution and is tough as nails. But we’ll have to
take care of him.”</p>

<p>The captain seemed to hesitate. “I—I suppose it wouldn’t do to talk to
him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, that would depend. It would hardly do any harm to talk to him a
moment and wish him a quick recovery. It wouldn’t be wise to talk to
him, though, if your conversation would excite him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it wouldn’t do,” said the captain regretfully. “Yet I wanted
very much to talk to him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be inquisitive, Captain, but perhaps if you could give
me an idea of what you want to say to him, I could judge if it would be
best. Perhaps, though, it is a private matter.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t, Doctor. It’s a matter that concerns us all. You are one
of my official family, and I may as well tell you. Only please do not
talk about it.”</p>

<p>“Of course I wouldn’t repeat what you say, Captain, but don’t tell me
unless you wish to do so.”</p>

<p>“You recall that we had a little difficulty with the wireless the
evening we got back to New York from Boston, don’t you, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That was the evening Sparks, here, got back aboard. I heard
something had gone wrong. But the chief electrician soon fixed it up, I
was told. I supposed that it didn’t amount to anything.”</p>

<p>“In a way, it didn’t. In another way, it was a very serious affair.”</p>

<p>“So?” queried the doctor.</p>

<p>“Yes. The difficulty was merely a grounded coil in the field. But the
coil had been grounded purposely, and grounded by some one on this
ship.” The surgeon was all attention. “We were just coming up the
channel and about to drop anchor. It was early evening—seven o’clock, to
be exact. Young Harper was on watch. He received a message for me, and,
leaving the wireless shack, he ran up to the bridge to me. I read the
message, wrote a reply, and Henry ran back to his key. A little later he
came charging back, to say that his wireless wouldn’t work. I sent for
the other wireless men. Belford was talking to the quartermaster beside
the wheelhouse. Black was fast asleep in his bunk. But Sharp came aboard
in a few moments, found the trouble, and fixed the outfit up.”</p>

<p>“That is what I had understood,” remarked the doctor.</p>

<p>“Next day,” continued the captain, “Mr. Sharp found out what had
grounded the defective coil. It was this.” And the commander held out
the bent finishing nail. “Some one had driven that nail into the coil in
those few minutes that Henry was up in the chart-room with me.”</p>

<p>“Can it be possible!” cried the doctor, amazed.</p>

<p>“I regret to say it is. What is more, Henry pulled on a coat of Black’s
after his ducking yesterday, and this morning he found these in the
pocket of that coat.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!” exclaimed the surgeon.</p>

<p>“And what’s still more,” continued the captain, “my quartermaster found
a hammer in Black’s bunk, that the carpenter says was stolen at supper
time of the evening we anchored—just a few minutes before the coil was
ruined. The hammer was lying, with nails like these, on the carpenter’s
work at the foot of the stairs leading to the mess-table. Furthermore,
Black and Harper had words, and Black threatened to fix Harper for
reporting him to me. The thing leads to Black as straight as a string.
But there’s one weak link in the chain of evidence: Black was asleep at
the time this was done.”</p>

<p>“When did you say it happened?”</p>

<p>“At seven o’clock in the evening, just as we were coming to anchor.”</p>

<p>The surgeon was silent a moment, lost in thought. Then suddenly he
spoke. “I remember it all very well. We were, as you say, just coming to
anchor. I recall it because I had been sent for to look after one of the
sailors who had crushed a finger while working with the anchor-chain. I
remember distinctly that the first thing I heard, when I put my head out
of the companionway, was the ship’s bell. It was exactly seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly the instant Henry was scampering up the ladder to me,”
said the captain.</p>

<p>“I hurried forward,” continued the surgeon. “A few seconds later I
reached the radio shack. A dark figure came tearing around the rear of
that structure and almost bumped into me. The fellow saw me and drew
back. I passed on. The fellow went into the radio room, for I distinctly
heard the door slam after I passed. He was evidently in too much of a
hurry to shut it quietly.”</p>

<p>The surgeon paused. “The fellow!” cried the captain. “Who was he? Have
you any idea?”</p>

<p>“I certainly have. Although it was perfectly dark out on deck, I saw the
man’s face clearly outlined against a light. It was Black.”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XX</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>HENRY’S EXONERATION</span>
</h2>

<p>With such a line of evidence against Black, the outcome of the
court-martial that quickly followed was a certainty. Black was
convicted, dishonorably discharged from the Coast Guard service,
sentenced to serve a prison term, and thrust into the brig, after being
stripped of his uniform.</p>

<p>Quite as naturally Henry was appointed to fill his place. The
appointment, however, could not become really effective until Henry
should receive his mother’s permission to enlist. He had no doubt her
consent would be forthcoming. He had already written to obtain it, and
was expecting a reply soon. Everybody on board seemed genuinely glad
when Henry was completely exonerated, and nobody was more pleased than
Captain Hardwick. He had come to like the lad immensely.</p>

<p>“Henry,” he said, “I never had more satisfaction in appointing any one
to a position under my command than I have in appointing you. If you
continue to be as faithful as you have been so far, there won’t be any
question, when your probationary three months are up, about your
confirmation as a permanent member of my wireless staff. With Mr. Sharp
and Mr. Belford and you, I shall have one of the best wireless staffs in
the service.”</p>

<p>Nor was Mr. Sharp or Belford one whit less pleased with the change in
the wireless staff. Neither of them had ever liked the third-class radio
man. When Mr. Sharp shook Henry’s hand in congratulation, Henry said,
“Mr. Sharp, I want you to teach me everything there is to know about
wireless.”</p>

<p>The chief electrician laughed. “I can’t do that, Henry,” he smiled. “I
don’t know everything myself. But I’ll be glad to teach you all I do
know. With two such students as you and Jimmy, I’ll have to hustle to
keep ahead of you.”</p>

<p>Even the weather seemed to rejoice with Henry, for the clouds
disappeared, the sun came out clear, and the day following the rescue of
the <i>Rayolite</i> was one of rare beauty. The <i>Iroquois</i> was able to
quicken her speed and bring her tow into New York Harbor before darkness
again fell.</p>

<p>As the cutter steamed up the channel, Henry got into touch with Roy and
flashed him the joyful news that the mystery of the field coil had been
solved, and that he himself had been exonerated and permanently
appointed third member of the radio staff.</p>

<p>There were more good things in store for Henry. Next day the mail boy
brought him two letters. One was from Willie, regretting his unforeseen
absence from New York and announcing his speedy return; and the other
was from Henry’s mother, giving her consent to his enlistment as a Coast
Guard wireless man.</p>

<p>Henry took his mother’s letter to Captain Hardwick. The captain smiled
with satisfaction as he read it. “That settles the matter for sure,” he
said. “This communication makes your appointment effective, and you are
now a regularly appointed member of my staff. My congratulations,
Sparks!”</p>

<p>Henry took the proffered hand. “It will be a great day for me, Captain,”
he said, “when I am a real Sparks like Mr. Sharp. I intend to be. I’m
going to study hard and climb up.”</p>

<p>“Your appointment is a probationary one, you understand,” said the
commander. “But I haven’t the least doubt that at the end of three
months I shall be able to confirm it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do all I possibly can to deserve such confirmation,” said Henry
stoutly. “We wireless men want to help you all we can, Captain.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could help me catch some dope smugglers that have been
bothering the custom officials here for a long time,” sighed the
captain. “But I don’t know how you could do it. These fellows have been
bringing opium into this port for months from Central America, and we
can’t touch them. Yet we are absolutely certain they are doing it. I
just got another letter this morning from the commandant of this
district, urging me to increase my vigilance.”</p>

<p>“Who are the fellows that bring in the opium, and how do they do it?”
asked Henry.</p>

<p>“The most notorious outfit is the steamer <i>Orient</i>, that plies between
New York and Panama.”</p>

<p>“How do you know she brings in opium?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t really know it. We know the stuff gets in, and we know
it comes from Panama by ship. The captain of the <i>Orient</i> has a shady
reputation and associates with men known to be dope handlers. He never
loses any of his crew, and that is suspicious in itself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said Henry.</p>

<p>“Oh, sailors go from boat to boat. They are a roving lot, and it is
seldom that a ship’s master can keep the same crew any length of time.
But there’s something so attractive about service on the <i>Orient</i> that
men seldom leave her. It isn’t because of the high tone of life aboard,
either, for they’re a rummy lot on that ship. We figure they are all in
on the opium business, and that the captain lets them share in the
profits. That’s the only explanation we can see for the situation.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you stop the <i>Orient</i> before she gets into the harbor and
search her?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“We would do that, but her master is foxy. He has a habit of appearing
in the harbor hours before he is expected. He’s here before we know he’s
anywhere near New York. There’s no use searching him after he’s in the
harbor, for he probably passes his stuff out to fishermen or boatmen
before he reaches the Narrows. Likely he drops it overboard, with buoys
to mark it, so his confederates can go out in small boats and pick it
up. We figure he must do it this way, for the custom guards have watched
his ship at her pier as a cat watches a mouse-hole, and they can never
get a thing that is suspicious.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you get a compass bearing on the <i>Orient</i> while she is at
sea?” asked Henry. “Then you could steam out and intercept her.”</p>

<p>“Sounds easy, but she won’t answer radio calls. That’s another
suspicious thing about her. When she does give her position, as she
sometimes does to her owners, we have found that she almost always gives
a false one. She’s nearer port by a good deal than she says she is.
We’ve tried lots of times to intercept her, and that’s the way she fools
us. If we had nothing else to do but catch the <i>Orient</i>, of course we’d
get her. But you’ve seen enough in your brief stay aboard the <i>Iroquois</i>
to know that the Coast Guard is a pretty busy organization. We don’t
have the time necessary to devote to a little matter like this. Yet this
smuggling ought to be stopped.”</p>

<p>Henry was all afire with the problem of helping his captain catch the
crooked commander of the <i>Orient</i>. He could think of nothing else all
that day. Finally an idea popped into his head. “Captain Hardwick,” he
said, as soon as he could find the commander, “wouldn’t the Navy Yard
wireless help us out?”</p>

<p>“Help us out? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, to catch the <i>Orient</i>, to be sure.”</p>

<p>The commander laughed. “Are you still thinking about that?” he said.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m thinking about it. You said you wanted help.”</p>

<p>“Well, bless my stars!” cried the commander. “Let’s hear all about it.
How is the Navy Yard wireless to help us catch the <i>Orient</i>?” He was
laughing good-naturedly, but he began to look interested as Henry
unfolded his plan.</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t the Navy Yard sound the <i>Orient’s</i> call and keep on
sending at intervals, whether she answered or not?”</p>

<p>“Doubtless the Navy Yard could, but what good would it do?”</p>

<p>“Why, sooner or later curiosity would get the better of the <i>Orient’s</i>
operator and he’d answer.”</p>

<p>“By George! He might. And what then?”</p>

<p>“Ask him some question that he would be likely to answer.”</p>

<p>“What, for instance?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you asked if the <i>Orient</i> had seen anything of some
long-overdue steamer that sails the same waters the <i>Orient</i> does,
wouldn’t he answer that? There is certainly nothing in such a request
that would arouse suspicion.”</p>

<p>“That might work,” said the captain thoughtfully. “It’s a thing that’s
often done. And the Navy Yard could call other boats far away from the
<i>Orient</i> and ask the same question. That would make it even less
suspicious. Yes, I believe that would work. The question is, ‘Are there
any boats that sail to southern waters that are now overdue?’” The
captain paused in thought. “I believe there are two,” he continued. “If
we got the <i>Orient</i>, we could ask her position. It wouldn’t matter
whether she gave it correctly or not. It would keep her wireless going
and give us more time to get a good compass bearing. I believe we’ll try
it.”</p>

<p>The captain got into his launch and went ashore. He was gone a long
time. When he returned, he called Henry to his cabin. “We’re going to
try your plan,” he said. “The Navy will call the <i>Orient</i>, and, if an
answer is received, will get a compass bearing and let us know where the
ship is and when she will arrive at Ambrose Lightship. We can meet her
and search her. You will likely hear the Navy Yard call the <i>Orient</i> if
you keep your ears open.”</p>

<p>Henry informed his fellow-watchers in the radio shack as to what was
afoot, and an element of interest was added to their watches. Also he
asked Mr. Sharp if he might try for a compass bearing himself, in case
the <i>Orient</i> was heard. “I’ve already used a radio compass,” said Henry.
“They had one at Frankfort, but that was a long time ago, and that
instrument would now be considered antiquated.” The chief radio man was
pleased to have so eager a pupil, and instructed Henry in all the
principles of the latest radio compass, such as the one on the
<i>Iroquois</i>.</p>

<p>By good luck Henry himself was on duty and caught the very first call
for the <i>Orient</i>. “WND—de—NAH,” signaled the operator at the Navy Yard.</p>

<p>But there was no reply. Again and again the watchers on the <i>Iroquois</i>
heard the call of the <i>Orient</i> flung out by the operator in the Navy
Yard. Finally the ruse succeeded. The <i>Orient’s</i> operator could stand it
no longer. He answered the call. When he did, Henry flew to the compass
shack, while Belford kept the watch. Again and again, as the Navy men
talked to the <i>Orient</i>, Henry revolved his compass until he was certain
he had the ship’s position, which he plotted on the map in the radio
room. The <i>Orient</i> had also given her position. This time Henry saw she
had told the truth. The position she gave agreed with that which he had
caught on the radio compass. Evidently she didn’t care to play crooked
with the Navy Yard. Eagerly Henry waited to see what the Navy Yard
operator would report. His report, of course, would have to come by
telephone. It would never have done to send it by wireless, lest the
<i>Orient</i> might hear as well as the <i>Iroquois</i>. The captain sent
Lieutenant Hill ashore to receive this telephone communication. When,
finally, Henry learned what the Navy Yard operator had to report, he
found that his own compass bearing agreed almost exactly with it. He was
delighted that he had been so accurate.</p>

<p>According to the calculations from the Navy Yard, the <i>Orient</i> could not
possibly arrive at the Ambrose Lightship before daybreak, but Captain
Hardwick was not willing to take any chances with a man he knew to be as
slippery as the commander of the <i>Orient</i>. Accordingly he got the custom
inspectors who were to accompany him, dropped down the Bay during the
night, and lay at anchor near the lightship, waiting for the opium
carrier.</p>

<p>Daybreak found the <i>Orient</i>, true to her reckoning, approaching the
<i>Iroquois</i>. The latter signaled to her to stop. Promptly the <i>Orient</i>
hove to, and Captain Hardwick sent two small boats, containing the half
dozen custom inspectors and a dozen of his own crew, to search the
southern freighter from stem to stern.</p>

<p>The commander of the <i>Orient</i> was plainly taken aback. Before he fully
realized what was happening, the boarding parties from the <i>Iroquois</i>
were swarming up the <i>Orient’s</i> ladder. Like oil on water, they spread
to all parts of the ship, before the crew could make a move to conceal
anything. Captain Hardwick knew what he was about when he sent twice as
many of his tars aboard as there were custom inspectors. The able seamen
made a dive for the forecastle and began a systematic search of the
sailors’ living quarters. Some of the custom inspectors sealed up the
cargo holds, so these could be inspected leisurely at the dock later on,
while others were examining the quarters aft. It was soon evident that
the search would require much time, so the workers settled down with
grim persistence, while the crew of the <i>Orient</i> passed jokes at their
expense and went as far as they dared in taunting the unsuccessful
searchers.</p>

<p>On the <i>Iroquois</i>, meanwhile, time passed slowly. There was nothing for
the sailors to do but sit about and wait for the return of their
comrades. In the radio house both Belford and Harper were trying to
possess themselves in patience. They sat with their feet up on the desk,
talking, with the wireless coupled up to the loud speaker. Whenever a
message sounded, they paused in their talk to listen.</p>

<p>“Just hear that. You might think it came from next door,” said Henry, as
a sudden signal fairly burst from the loud speaker. “Only that isn’t the
<i>Orient’s</i> call.”</p>

<p>OIN was calling RET. “They’re queer calls,” commented Belford. “I never
heard either before.”</p>

<p>RET answered OIN almost immediately, and in another instant the message
was booming in the loud speaker. Belford copied it as it came. “No fish
today. Held up by sharks. All safe aloft.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a queer message,” said Henry. “Some fishermen with a
wireless outfit, I suppose, telling a customer he has nothing for him.
Probably been out in a gale, and escaped damage to his top-hamper. I
can’t understand about the sharks, though. They might scare away the
fish, but I don’t see how they could hold up a boat.”</p>

<p>They resumed their conversation. Time passed. After some hours one of
the small boats returned from the <i>Orient</i>, with some of the sailors.
The remainder, and the custom officials, were still aboard. It had been
decided to proceed to New York without further loss of time. The search
would continue during the run, and the sealed cargo holds could be
examined at the pier.</p>

<p>Slowly the <i>Orient</i> got under way and headed for the harbor, convoyed by
the <i>Iroquois</i>. When they were halfway up the channel, the two lads in
the radio shack paused again to listen to another message from the loud
speaker. RET was calling OIN, and the signal sounded weak and far away,
but when OIN replied, the signals fairly screeched from the loud
speaker.</p>

<p>“By George!” cried Henry. “That OIN must be mighty close at hand. The
call could hardly be louder if it came from the <i>Orient</i> here. I’m
curious to know where it does come from.”</p>

<p>When RET began sending, Belford again wrote down the message. “Put fish
in trap when leaving port. Glad top-hamper safe.”</p>

<p>“Jiminy crickets!” said Belford. “That’s a funny one. OIN says he has no
fish for RET, and RET turns around and tells him to put the fish in the
trap when he leaves port. That doesn’t sound sensible to me.”</p>

<p>He shoved the scraps of paper bearing the messages over to Henry. Jimmy
had written the messages close together, like this:</p>

<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>RET de OIN: “No fish today.</div>
<div class='cbline'>Held up by sharks. All safe aloft.”</div>
<div class='blankline'></div>
<div class='cbline'>OIN de RET: “Put fish in trap when</div>
<div class='cbline'>leaving port. Glad top-hamper</div>
<div class='cbline'>safe.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Henry looked at the sheet of paper lazily for a moment. Then he almost
sprang out of his chair. “Look, Jimmy!” he cried. “See how the letters
of those two calls combine.” He pointed to the signals his companion had
written down at the commencement of each line. “If you begin with O,
then jump up to R, and keep on moving from bottom line to top, you get
the word ‘Orient.’ I believe we’ve caught something important.”</p>

<p>Belford pulled the paper toward himself and studied the riddle. “Jiminy
crickets!” he cried. “You’re right, Henry. What do you suppose it all
means? I thought from the first that there was something queer about
those calls.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Henry, “it is perfectly evident that OIN must be mighty
close at hand, the way her signal comes cracking in. That’s just the way
a signal would sound from the <i>Orient</i>. And RET is either very far away,
or else has a weak little set. Inasmuch as we are going into port and
the message seems to be to a customer, I’d guess that the customer has a
weak little outfit—probably a home-made affair run by dry cells. But
what all this stuff about fish and sharks means, I can’t guess.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose we ought to bother the captain with it?”</p>

<p>“It won’t do any harm. If this message was from the <i>Orient</i>, it has
some hidden meaning, and of course the captain ought to know about it.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you take it to him, Henry.”</p>

<p>Henry grabbed up the sheet of paper and went to the captain. “Bless my
stars!” ejaculated the captain, when he had read the two messages. “This
is as good as a Sunday newspaper puzzle. And it’s about as easy to
guess. Fish would mean opium, of course; and if sharks are the things
that held back the opium, I reckon either we or the custom men are the
sharks. Maybe they meant Sparks, eh?” And the captain laughed merrily at
Henry.</p>

<p>“Maybe Sparks will stop them, after all,” grinned Henry.</p>

<p>“Let’s turn it into plain English,” continued the captain. “‘We cannot
deliver any opium to you today because the custom officials have grabbed
us. Everything is safe aloft.’ Now why should he tell his customer that
his rigging is still all right? What has that to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Captain, unless it has something to do with the opium.”</p>

<p>“By George!” cried the commander. “Let’s put it that way. We’ll read the
message all over again. ‘We cannot deliver you any opium today because
the custom officials have grabbed us. But the stuff is safe aloft.’”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose it means that?” cried Henry, much excited.</p>

<p>“You can guess as well as I can. Now let’s go on with this thing. What
does the answer say? Let’s see.” The captain bent over the paper again
and read, “‘Put fish in trap when leaving port. Glad top-hamper is
safe.’” He paused and chuckled. “Plain as day, isn’t it, Henry? ‘Put
your opium in the trap when you leave the harbor. We’re glad your opium
is safe.’ If we haven’t guessed their little riddle, I’ll eat my hat.
Come on, we’ll see whether we are right or not.”</p>

<p>The commander went on deck. Jimmy flashed an order for the <i>Orient</i> to
heave to again. A small boat was lowered and in a few moments the
commander of the cutter stood on the deck of the freighter. The
searchers looked grim. The <i>Orient’s</i> crew were grinning.</p>

<p>“What success?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“None,” said the leader of the custom officials.</p>

<p>Captain Hardwick removed his cap and began to scan the top-hamper of the
<i>Orient</i>. He saw that the forward crow’s-nest was unusually large and
commodious. He called two of his sailors. “Boys,” he cried, “skip up the
rigging and take a look in those crow’s-nests. Make sure there are no
false bottoms in them.”</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Orient</i> lost their grins, as the sailors from the
cutter hustled up the rigging. “Nothing here,” called down the sailor
who had mounted to the after crow’s-nest. The man on the forward mast
did not answer so promptly. He was measuring with eye and arm the inner
and outer dimensions of the big crow’s-nest. Suddenly his eye caught
sight of a nail, bent like a hook, that projected above the flooring at
one edge of the crow’s-nest. He crooked a finger under it and pulled.
The whole floor came up. Beneath it, packed tightly together, were
enough cans of opium to fill several suit-cases.</p>

<p>“The stuff is here, Captain,” called the sailor.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXXI' title='XXI: AMONG THE ICEBERGS'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>AMONG THE ICEBERGS</span>
</h2>

<p>After the discovery of the opium, Captain Hardwick took his sailors back
to the <i>Iroquois</i>, along with the confiscated drug, leaving the custom
inspectors aboard the <i>Orient</i>, to search the sealed cargo holds at the
pier. Off Staten Island the <i>Iroquois</i> dropped behind the freighter and
was soon swinging once more at her anchor.</p>

<p>For some time she lay there undisturbed. The seas were calm and no
emergency calls came to the little cutter. Henry was delighted at that,
for Willie had returned, and the two boys and Roy now were able to see
each other frequently. At any of his four-hour periods off duty Henry
was free to slip over to Manhattan, and so cordial was the feeling now
existing among the wireless men on the <i>Iroquois</i>, that either Jimmy
Belford or the chief electrician was willing enough to work overtime on
occasion to give Henry a bit more freedom. They knew well enough that he
would gladly reciprocate when need arose. Many a night now saw the three
boys from Central City happy together in the snug wireless cabin of the
<i>Lycoming</i>. It was, indeed, a great joy to them to be so near one
another.</p>

<p>Winter came, and with it winter cruising. For periods of a week or ten
days the <i>Iroquois</i> and her sister cutters cruised on the open sea, some
patrolling along the shores to prevent the landing of alcoholic drink,
some standing off dangerous coasts, to be on hand should vessels become
endangered. No unusual storms arose that winter, but all the time it was
boisterous out on the ocean, for the winds never ceased, and the sea was
in perpetual turmoil.</p>

<p>Christmas found Henry thus at sea. For him it was a memorable Christmas,
too, because it was the first one he had ever spent away from home. He
felt a bit blue about it, but fought down the touch of homesickness that
came to him. Perhaps the sea helped him to do that. On this particular
day the ocean was tremendously rough. The cutter had worked far to the
northward, and all day long had pitched about as Henry had never seen
her pitch before. The cooks had prepared a goodly Christmas dinner, but
it could not be served at the table. Instead it was passed out in
chunks, to be eaten from one hand, while with the other hand each man
clung to anything that offered support. The sea was so rough one could
hardly stand without a prop.</p>

<p>It was a foretaste of what was to come in the following spring, when the
<i>Iroquois</i> went to the Grand Banks, on ice patrol. When the great ice
fields of the frozen north disintegrate, and huge icebergs float south,
passing through the steamer lanes, and so endangering steamship traffic,
it was part of the work of the Coast Guard to protect shipping from
these menacing mountains of ice. One <i>Titanic</i> disaster was enough for
the world.</p>

<p>When it came time for the <i>Iroquois</i> to relieve the <i>Oneida</i> in the ice
fields, the ship was made ready and the long voyage begun. At Halifax
the cutter touched to refill her water tanks and renew her stores. Then
she headed northeast into the region of fog and storm and tremendous
moving mountains of ice.</p>

<p>As long as he lives, Henry will never forget that journey through the
tossing, fog-shrouded sea. For days on end the sun had not shone. No
stars were visible at night. The dull gray sea and the dull gray clouds,
with the thick shrouded mists, lent a leaden tone to life which was like
nothing Henry had ever known. Onward, league after league, day after
day, the little cutter rolled and pitched, tossed by a sea the like of
which Henry had never imagined.</p>

<p>Only by dead reckoning could the commander tell where he was. He had so
recently left Halifax that he could not be so very far astray in his
calculations. But the <i>Oneida</i> had not been able to take a sight for
three weeks, so it was not surprising, therefore, that when she gave her
position to the <i>Iroquois</i> by wireless, and the <i>Iroquois</i> proceeded to
the given spot, no cutter was to be seen. When Captain Hardwick found
that the <i>Oneida</i> was not at the given position, he wired: “<i>Iroquois</i>
is at the meeting point named. Will await you.” And at once the <i>Oneida</i>
flashed back the reply: “There is some mistake. We are at the position
named. Will await you.”</p>

<p>What a puzzle this situation would have been in the days before the
radio compass was invented, and what a game of blind man’s buff those
two little cutters would have played among the fogs and mists and
icebergs of the Grand Banks. But now Captain Hardwick simply telegraphed
the <i>Oneida</i> to remain at anchor and give him a compass bearing. Soon
Mr. Sharp came out of the compass shack and told the commander which way
to go. That was all there was to it. A few hours later the two ships lay
side by side. The <i>Oneida</i>, unable to see the sun for so long, was a
great distance from the position she thought she occupied.</p>

<p>As Henry was to learn, there was great reason why a ship should float
far and wide in this region of moving mountains of ice. The Grand Banks,
formed by the deposit of sediment carried north by the Gulf Stream, are
enormous eminences in the bottom of the sea, like huge mountain plateaus
rising in a vast valley. These banks rise upward to within two hundred
feet of the ocean’s surface, while the bed of the sea around them is
thousands of feet deep. Naturally these great banks of sand deflect the
sea currents. The Gulf Stream itself bends farther to the east. There
are currents and cross currents, and wind and sea are often terrible
beyond description.</p>

<p>Icebergs float with seven-eighths of their bulk submerged, so no large
bergs can ever cross the Grand Banks; they are too deep for the shallow
waters there. But in the deeper parts of the sea they stream southward
from the polar ice fields in droves, scattering in every direction with
wind and current. Some go with the Labrador current. Coming south, some
swing up again and go northeast. Others continue straight on down to the
shipping lanes. Some get into the Gulf Stream and are further deflected
from their courses. And all these companies of icebergs, scattered over
vast areas, one little cutter is supposed to watch and guard. Of course
she cannot herd them together and drive them away from the shipping
lanes, but she can and does drive ships away from the icebergs. She does
this by wireless.</p>

<p>Day after day the <i>Iroquois</i> cruised among the bergs, charting the
position of each, noting the currents in which each floated, trying to
plot the probable course of each moving mountain of ice. And every four
hours the man at the wireless key sent flashing abroad a detailed
warning to ships, telling where each menacing berg was located and what
course it would probably take. And at night the <i>Iroquois</i> lay at rest,
floating upon the bosom of the deep. It was dangerous enough to run
through the ice fields in the daytime, when concealing mists made vision
well-nigh impossible. To steam through them at night would be almost
suicidal.</p>

<p>Anxious days were these for the commander of the <i>Iroquois</i>. At any
moment his little cutter was likely to be disabled merely by the
violence of the sea. At any moment the ship might crash into some
fog-shrouded berg. Ceaseless vigilance was necessary to insure safety.</p>

<p>Almost greater vigilance was required to keep track of the huge bergs.
Some of them towered two hundred feet in air, which meant that they were
many hundred feet deep. Continually they were “calving,” or throwing off
great shoulders of ice, called growlers. Every time a berg calved, its
centre of gravity was disturbed and its contour altered. It rode at a
new angle. Thus the berg that today resembled a cathedral might tomorrow
look like a storage warehouse. Yet it was necessary, for the purpose of
scientific observation, that each southward-floating berg be definitely
identified. Oceanographers were now aboard the <i>Iroquois</i>, to study this
matter of iceberg drift, that shipping might be better protected in
future years. It was necessary that they should know each berg they met,
no matter where they encountered it. But to recognize a berg that was
continually altering its own appearance was an accomplishment that not
even the learned oceanographers possessed. As yet, no way to identify
bergs had ever been devised.</p>

<p>But Captain Hardwick was a resourceful man, and one day he declared that
he had solved the problem. “I’m going to paint them,” he declared. His
hearers laughed incredulously. But the captain cared little for their
amusement. He ordered some shells brought from the magazine and some
paints from the storeroom. Then, under the captain’s personal
supervision, the gunner loaded shell after shell with paint. Bright reds
and greens and blues and other startling colors were used. When all was
ready, the captain smiled with satisfaction. “I’m going to try it out on
the very next berg we see,” he laughed.</p>

<p>An hour later the lookout announced that a berg was visible. It took the
cutter more than an hour to reach it, however, for it was sixteen miles
away. It was two hundred and fifty feet high, and Henry was so
astonished at this enormous mass of glittering white ice that he could
find no words to describe it, or his astonishment either. The <i>Iroquois</i>
worked up close to the berg, a spot was selected by the captain to aim
at, high up on the broad side of the monster, the gunner elevated and
sighted one of the guns, and a charge of paint went shooting out of a
cannon’s mouth. A second later the shell crashed against the lofty berg,
and a huge crimson stain began to spread over its side. Then the
<i>Iroquois</i> steamed around to the other side of the berg and repeated the
dose. “If that doesn’t do the trick,” laughed the commander, “my name
isn’t Hardwick.”</p>

<p>They were still calling the commander by that name a week later,
however, for when the <i>Iroquois</i> had cruised the length of her beat and
was returning, she again came upon the crimson-sided ice mass. A cross
current had brought it back close to where it had been painted. Other
bergs were tinted with other colors, and there was something new under
the sun. The wireless broadcasts now warned vessels to look out for the
berg with the green, or the red, or the blue sides. A way had been found
to brand these monsters of the deep.</p>

<p>But of all his experiences in the ice fields, nothing so much interested
Henry as the destruction of a huge berg that came wallowing down from
the frozen north and went ploughing straight along toward the tropics.
Apparently neither wind nor sea nor any other agency could turn this
menacing mountain of ice aside from its path. Down to the northern
steamship lane it went, and the <i>Iroquois</i> went with it, warning all
shipping of its presence. It was enormous. It towered more than two
hundred feet in air, and was hundreds of feet long and huge in width. It
did not break up into growlers when it reached the warmer parts of the
sea, as most of the bergs did, but kept on, implacable, menacing,
terrible.</p>

<p>Through the northern steamer lane and on to the southern lane, the huge
block of ice steadily made its way. Thus it endangered ships going both
to and from European ports. But the <i>Iroquois</i> stayed by the giant berg
and warned all ships of the danger. When it reached a point farther
south than the <i>Iroquois’</i> own port, and still did not disintegrate, the
commander of the cutter took steps to break it up by artificial means.</p>

<p>A small boat was lowered, and two mines, each containing fifty-two
pounds of TNT, were loaded aboard, with firing batteries and other
necessary equipment. Then Lieutenant Hill, with a picked crew of
oarsmen, manned the boat, towing behind it a float with a sail attached.
The party made its way to windward of the berg, where the mines were
suspended from the float, so that they hung about eight feet below the
surface of the water. The sail on the float was spread, and while the
wind drove it toward the berg, the sailors pulled in the opposite
direction. But the matter was not so simple as it seemed. The backlash
of the sea kept the raft from reaching the great mass of ice, and,
instead of hitting it, it floated to one side and on toward the open
sea.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hill caught the raft, and now an attempt was made to tow it
across the face of the berg with a buoyed line, the tow rope being kept
up at intervals with life preservers. But all about the base of the
berg, like detritus at the bottom of a precipice, were great quantities
of slush ice, little growlers, and the like, so that the mine could not
be dragged against the main berg.</p>

<p>Then an effort was made to drive spikes into the side of the ice, so
that the mines could be hung to them. It was dangerous business,
standing up in a tossing little boat, with a possibility of being
pitched out and crushed between it and the berg, but the sailors made
the attempt without mishap—and without success. All efforts to drive
anything into the ice were futile. It broke under the hammer blows, and
no nail could be forced into it.</p>

<p>Next a grapnel was tried. The small boat was forced through the slush
ice at the foot of the berg until a place was found where a little ledge
in the shoulder seemed to offer a chance for a hold. The grapnel was
thrown, but it slid off into the water. Again and again the effort was
repeated. Each time it failed. The hooks of the grapnel would not catch
in the slippery ice.</p>

<p>The backlash of the sea constantly showered the small boat with spray.
All hands were soaked. The firing batteries became wet and useless, and
the lieutenant put back to the <i>Iroquois</i> for fresh ones.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try the grapnel again,” he called up to the commander,
after making known his need for dry batteries.</p>

<p>“Captain Hardwick,” said Henry, “why not shoot a line over that berg?
Then one could hang a mine on the other end of it on the far side of the
berg.”</p>

<p>The captain leaned over the rail of the cutter and called down to the
lieutenant: “Never mind about the grapnel. Our able third-class radio
man says to shoot a line over the berg, so bend your energies to that.
I’ll get you a shoulder gun. It’s worth trying.” He sent a man for both
the battery and the gun, and the two were passed into the rowboat.</p>

<p>Back to the berg went the little craft. When it was close beside the
middle of the berg, the lieutenant put the gun to his shoulder, while a
sailor made sure that the line would run free. At a favorable moment the
lieutenant fired high over the mass of ice. The projectile flew true,
whisking the line after it. The small boat was brought close to the base
of the berg, a weight was attached to the end of the shot-line, and then
the boat rowed round the berg and picked up the other end of the line.</p>

<p>The lieutenant now had something to which to attach his mines. Together
they weighed more than one hundred pounds. Carefully these were bent to
the shot-line and lowered until they rested against the base of the ice,
thirty feet below the surface of the sea. The small boat pulled far
away, and the shot was fired. The report was a muffled roar. Immense
quantities of ice came crashing down from the titanic shoulders of the
berg, with thunderous reverberations. The sound was startling. The
mountain of ice itself began to rise, the huge bulk lifting straight up
out of the water, as though a giant hand were pushing it from beneath.
Ten feet it rose, then twenty, and yet it continued to lift. At thirty
feet there was a sharp crack, and the huge mass broke fairly in halves.
Then it fell back into the sea, throwing out an enormous wave. Each half
was a third as large as the original berg had been. The remaining third
was the broken ice that had come rattling down from the giant’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>For the first time in history an iceberg had been destroyed by
artificial means, for within twenty-four hours the two huge chunks of
this monster had completely disintegrated. Nothing but small growlers
and slush ice encumbered the sea. TNT had been more than a match for the
ice king.</p>

</h2>

<p>For two weeks the <i>Iroquois</i> herded the floes of ice. Then the <i>Oneida</i>
relieved her and the <i>Iroquois</i> sailed to Halifax, where she renewed her
supplies and equipment preparatory to another two weeks of struggle with
the army of the ice king. So it went for long months, but finally the
last of the bergs disappeared. The <i>Oneida</i> had already gone back to
Boston. Now the <i>Iroquois</i> bade farewell to the fogs and storms of the
Grand Banks and gleefully headed for her home anchorage in the shelter
of old St. George.</p>

<p>But ere she reached her longed-for haven, duty once more turned her prow
away from home. The little cutter, driving as fast as steam and the
eagerness of her crew could send her, was far off the New England coast
when, shortly after evening mess one foggy day, Henry picked out of the
air that ever-startling call,
“<b>QST—QST—QST—QRT—QRT—QRT—SOS—SOS—SOS—SOS—SOS</b>: Steamers <i>Wilmington</i>
and <i>Hiawatha</i> in collision. Position sixty-four ten west, forty-three
north.”</p>

<p>It was the <i>Wilmington’s</i> operator who was sending. The instant he
signed off, Henry’s key was sounding. He flashed the <i>Wilmington’s</i>
call, <b>KGD</b>, and asked, “Do you require assistance?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” came the answer. “Require assistance immediately.”</p>

<p>Henry called a sailor and sent the message to the commander. Then he
returned to his key, and again signaled the <i>Wilmington</i>. “How badly are
you hurt?” he queried.</p>

<p>“<i>Wilmington’s</i> bow crushed. Number one hold full of water. <i>Hiawatha’s</i>
stern damaged. Propeller broken. <i>Hiawatha</i> in tow. Making for Halifax.
Speed three knots an hour.”</p>

<p>The sailor came hurrying back with a message to the <i>Wilmington</i>. Henry
handed him the communication he had just received, and flashed out the
message the sailor had brought, “Cutter <i>Iroquois</i> to your assistance.
Hardwick, Commander.”</p>

<p>With all the speed he could muster, Captain Hardwick was coming, too. On
through the fog and the dark the little cutter went rushing as fast as
steam and muscle would drive her. In the engine-room grimy oilers tended
their machines as carefully as a mother watches her babe. Like demons
the firemen fed the furnaces, and the coal passers worked unceasingly.
Through mist and fog and surging billow the <i>Iroquois</i> drove on and on.
At ten minutes of nine Henry caught another call, “Same course. Going
about on account bad steering. Call first fifteen minutes each hour.”</p>

<p>An hour later came the cry, “We have stopped now. Unable to proceed.
When can we expect you?”</p>

<p>By every means at his command the captain of the <i>Iroquois</i> tried to
hasten the little cutter, but already every soul on board was working at
top capacity. Under forced draught, in heat almost unbearable, the men
in the fireroom fed and stoked the fires with an energy well-nigh
superhuman. From stem to stern the little cutter trembled and shook with
the intensity of her efforts. Never had she traveled faster, yet hours
must elapse before she could reach the injured steamers. Reluctantly
Henry sent the discouraging word. And hardly had he finished, before
there came to him the startling call, “Have you anything for me? Antennæ
may soon carry away.”</p>

<p>It was just ten o’clock. Both Mr. Sharp and Jimmy had joined Henry in
the wireless shack. They looked at one another with questioning, fearful
eyes.</p>

<p>“She must be damaged more than we thought,” said Mr. Sharp. “God grant
she stays afloat till we get there.”</p>

<p>At ten thirty-five came a reassuring flash from the <i>Wilmington</i>: “Have
cast loose from the <i>Hiawatha</i>. Cannot steer. Heading into wind. Will
proceed as wind abates. Water not gaining. Antennæ will carry away soon.
Will answer your light by rockets. Will fire rockets every half hour.”</p>

<p>Jimmy rushed the message to the commander on the bridge. Mr. Sharp began
to look very sober. “She must be worse than we think,” he repeated. “I
can’t understand why her antennæ should be about to carry away. It must
be blowing hard. A storm is coming where she is. I’m afraid of that
wind. Her forward bulkhead is all that keeps her from sinking; it
confines the water to her number one hold. But if the sea makes up, the
pressure will smash that bulkhead, sure. The <i>Hiawatha’s</i> helpless now.
She’ll drift fast before the wind. We’ve certainly got our work cut out
for us.”</p>

<p>Grave, indeed, was the face of the commander, when he learned what had
occurred. “Tell Mr. Sharp to get into communication with the <i>Hiawatha</i>
at once,” he directed, “and have her keep in touch with us. The
<i>Wilmington</i> is evidently much more badly injured. We must go to her
first and get her men. We’ll steam for the Hiawatha the minute we have
rescued them.”</p>

<p>On rushed the cutter. Through fog and dark she drove, fighting with
every ounce of her power to win her way to the side of her crippled
sister. Without, the night was black as pitch. From the sea came that
ominous, moaning sound that betokens a storm. Aloft the cordage shrieked
and wailed. As the ship rushed on, the wind rose steadily higher.</p>

<p>At eleven thirty-five came the message, “We are firing rockets now.”</p>

<p>At midnight the <i>Wilmington</i> sent her position. In all her hours of
struggle she had won but pitifully few miles toward safety. When Henry
had copied down this message, he laid aside the headphones and
surrendered his place to Jimmy. He had worked two hours overtime, but no
one in the radio shack had given a thought to time. They were tense with
anxiety about the <i>Wilmington</i>. Now Henry took his message to the
captain. Mr. Sharp told him he had better get some sleep, but sleep was
impossible. Every minute the wind was coming stronger, and the sea was
getting up. The thought of those wretched sailors, waiting helplessly
for the <i>Iroquois</i>, their vessel likely to sink at any moment, moved
Henry powerfully. Never could he forget the sight of those poor fellows
from the <i>Iroquois</i> that he had seen struggle so hard for their lives in
the sea off Cape Cod. The men of the <i>Wilmington</i> might at any moment be
in the same situation. With such thoughts surging through his excited
brain he could not sleep, so he returned to the radio shack.</p>

<p>At half-past three in the morning a rocket was seen. Long before this
the <i>Iroquois</i> had broken out her searchlight, shooting a great finger
of light through the darkness ahead, then pointing the beam upward
toward the heavens, so that it could be seen afar. The cutter rushed on,
crew and commander heartened by the streaks of fire that now shot
heavenward at intervals in the darkness ahead. By four o’clock the
<i>Wilmington</i> herself could be seen plainly, and a little while later the
<i>Iroquois</i> lay close alongside, her searchlight playing on the injured
ship.</p>

<p>The freighter’s prow was bent, and she had settled a little forward, but
otherwise she appeared to be in good condition. On the far side of her
was a gaping hole in her nose that was not visible from the <i>Iroquois</i>.
She looked as though she were still good for a struggle.</p>

<p>But the crew of the cutter had not long to speculate about the condition
of the disabled ship. Down from her davits dropped the huge lifeboat
full of men. A moment it paused alongside, while the sailors who had
manned the falls slid down them into the boat. Then the little craft was
shoved clear of the crippled ship and pulled over to the <i>Iroquois</i>. Up
the side of the cutter the frightened sailors scrambled like terrified
sheep. Plainly they were foreigners. And the commander of the <i>Iroquois</i>
opened his eyes wide, when he noted that many of them were Englishmen.
He was not surprised that the others were panic-stricken.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Wilmington</i> was the last man to come aboard. His
expression was pitiful. “I could have saved my ship,” he cried, “if it
had not been for this cowardly crew. The forward hold is full of water,
but the bulkhead is holding well. We could have made Halifax in a few
hours.”</p>

<p>The executive officer was standing by. “Captain Hardwick,” he said,
“will you allow me to take a volunteer crew and work the <i>Wilmington</i>
into Halifax? It’s a crime to abandon a ship like that.”</p>

<p>“You may try it, Mr. Harris, if you wish.”</p>

<p>The executive officer turned and faced the crew of the <i>Iroquois</i>, who
were gathered forward of the ladder. “How many of you are willing to
help me work the <i>Wilmington</i> into Halifax?” he cried.</p>

<p>The crew sprang forward as one man. The commander of the Wilmington
strode over to Mr. Harris. “I’m going back with you,” he said. Half a
dozen of the Englishmen followed. “We’re with you, Captain,” they said.</p>

<p>The executive officer chose twenty men from the crew of the <i>Iroquois</i>.
They climbed down the ladder into the <i>Wilmington’s</i> waiting boat, the
Englishmen following. The executive officer, who had been below all the
evening, drew off his low shoes and began to pull on high laced boots.</p>

<p>Henry ran out of the radio shack. “Please, may I go?” he cried.</p>

<p>“No,” said the executive officer. “This is no place for boys.”</p>

<p>Henry fell on his knees and began to lace up the executive officer’s
boots. “Please, Mr. Harris,” he pleaded. “You can’t get along without a
radio man.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Wilmington’s</i> own radio man is going back,” said the executive
officer shortly.</p>

<p>“But he will need a relief.”</p>

<p>“Not before we reach Halifax.”</p>

<p>“Then let me go and sling chow. You haven’t any mess-boy. I can do other
jobs between meals.”</p>

<p>By this time the executive officer was almost in the boat. He took a
last look upward.</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Harris,” pleaded Henry, “please let me go.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then,” growled the executive officer. “But it’s no place for
boys.”</p>

<p>Eagerly Henry followed his leader into the waiting boat. The craft was
pushed away from the cutter and strong arms soon carried her alongside
the <i>Wilmington</i>. In a few moments more the lifeboat swung at her
davits, and the volunteer crew had scattered to their respective posts.
Slowly the crippled ship got under way. She seemed to ride safely, and
the prospects for saving her were excellent. For a little while the
<i>Iroquois</i> lay motionless, while her commander studied the movements of
the <i>Wilmington</i>. Then, satisfied that she could make her goal, Captain
Hardwick signaled the men in the engine-room, the cutter began to move,
and soon was steaming steadily away from the <i>Wilmington</i>, to begin her
search for the <i>Hiawatha</i>. But Captain Hardwick had not seen the gaping
hole in the far side of the Wilmington’s nose.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Wilmington</i> every one was working at top speed. Men who
had never passed coal before, now hustled fuel for the furnaces. The few
experienced firemen in the volunteer crew were supplemented by
inexperienced men. The engines were tended, the pumps were kept running,
the ship was navigated, and all was done with heroic determination. Even
the firemen, like everybody else, worked double shifts. The man who was
to cook passed coal for hours, then washed and made hot coffee and
sandwiches, which Henry passed to the men to munch while they labored.
Then Henry went below to pass coal. Everybody on board was working with
dogged determination. They were going to get the <i>Wilmington</i> into
Halifax if it was humanly possible.</p>

<p>Nobly the crippled freighter responded. She forged through the waves
faster and faster until she was making seven and a half knots an hour.
With satisfaction Mr. Harris sent the good news to the commander of the
<i>Iroquois</i>. But even at seven and a half knots an hour, the <i>Wilmington</i>
had a long journey before her, and all the while the sea was rising.</p>

<p>Dawn came, but no sun followed to light the day. The mists and fogs
increased. The wind bellowed with ever-increasing force. The seas
mounted upward, higher and higher, and with every passing hour the storm
grew worse. Viciously the waves crashed against the broken nose of the
<i>Wilmington</i>. Slower rode the crippled steamer, and slower still. Both
wind and seas held her back, and her commander dared not drive her with
the full power of his engines. The strain on the bulkhead was terrific.</p>

<p>Noon came. The <i>Wilmington</i> was still moving, though slowly. The
<i>Iroquois</i> had found the <i>Hiawatha</i> and taken her in tow. The <i>Oneida</i>
was rushing out from Boston to help. At regular intervals the
<i>Wilmington’s</i> wireless man sent some message to the <i>Iroquois</i>. By
early afternoon these became alarming. The pumps were no longer holding
their own, and water was gaining in the hold of the <i>Wilmington</i>. By two
o’clock the disabled ship was down by the head. She could no longer buck
the seas.</p>

<p>A little later her commander wired to Captain Hardwick, “Am trying to
steam backward.”</p>

<p>When he got the message, Captain Hardwick was worried, indeed. “They’ll
never make it,” he declared to Mr. Sharp. “Ask the <i>Oneida</i> to hurry. We
shall likely have to abandon the <i>Hiawatha</i> and go back to the
<i>Wilmington</i>.”</p>

<p>On board the <i>Wilmington</i>, the volunteer crew was making a superhuman
effort to carry on. The attempt to steam backward was unsuccessful.
Lower settled the nose of the ship. It was desirable to make a sea
anchor, to hold the ship’s head to the waves. But now the combers were
crashing over the settling bow of the steamer, and water was pouring
into her hold through hatchways. It was impossible for men to go below
and get the materials necessary to make the sea anchor. Disabled,
sinking steadily lower in the bow, the crippled vessel now rolled
helplessly in the sea. It was merely a question of time until she should
go under.</p>

<p>At three o’clock the <i>Wilmington</i> flashed a message to the <i>Iroquois</i>.
Mr. Sharp went white when he read it. “We are rolling helplessly and
settling fast. Vessel is doomed. Am preparing to abandon ship. Will
remain till last minute. Need help immediately.”</p>

<p>The instant Captain Hardwick read the order, he cast loose from the
<i>Hiawatha</i> and headed about to save his own men. He sent a reassuring
message to the <i>Wilmington</i>, then another to the <i>Hiawatha</i>, telling her
to make a sea anchor, and keep in touch with the <i>Oneida</i>, which would
reach her in a few hours.</p>

<p>All the while wind and sea grew worse. But little did the commander of
the <i>Iroquois</i> care. He had weathered many a storm that was worse than
this. He thought of only one thing: he must get to his men. Relentlessly
he pushed the cutter. He drove the crew. He was everywhere, thinking of
every contingency, preparing for every emergency. He had the sick bay
prepared. He got cots and medicines in readiness. He warned the cook to
be ready with hot drinks and food. Men and ship alike responded to the
dynamic influence of their commander and drove the ship at a pace
incredible.</p>

<p>As the sturdy cutter tore her way through the seas to reach the
<i>Wilmington</i>, that doomed vessel sank lower and lower in the head and
rolled ever more helplessly in the waves. Yet she floated. The bulkhead
still held. The pumps could still be operated, and the volunteers were
working feverishly to keep up steam and keep the pumps at work. Even
though the water gained, it gained but slowly.</p>

<p>Darkness came. The cutter was still far away. There were few rockets
left to fire, but every half hour one was shot skyward. A great flare
was made on deck, but with waves and spray dashing over the ship it was
difficult to keep the beacon burning. All the while the wireless men
kept in touch with the <i>Iroquois</i>. At times Henry relieved him.</p>

<p>“We are listing very badly,” he called. “We cannot stay afloat much
longer. How long will it take you to reach us?”</p>

<p>Afar off, the watchers on the <i>Wilmington</i> could now discern the beam
from the searchlight of the <i>Iroquois</i>, like a great pencil of light
reaching from sea to sky. Slowly it grew more distinct, but, oh, so
slowly. The efforts to keep the beacon burning were redoubled. Once more
Henry sent flashing a cry for help: “We are sinking fast.”</p>

<p>Meantime, with some planks from one of the after holds, the men had made
life rafts. These were placed close to the stern, ready to be pitched
into the sea at a second’s warning. A single boat remained—the one that
had brought the crew from the <i>Iroquois</i>. All the others had been lost,
some in the collision, while others had been torn away by the waves as
the <i>Wilmington</i> rolled in the trough of the sea.</p>

<p>On came the <i>Iroquois</i>, though she was yet far away. “We are leaving
immediately,” Henry signaled at the direction of Mr. Harris. “We have
made some life rafts. Stand by to pick us up.”</p>

<p>When he had sent the message, Henry rejoined his commander on the after
deck of the <i>Wilmington</i>, where all the men were now gathered. The bow
of the freighter had sunk alarmingly. The big lifeboat still swung at
the <i>Wilmington’s</i> davits, but these were peculiar, and held the boat so
that every roll of the ship threatened to submerge the little craft. To
save it from destruction, it was necessary to get it into the sea.</p>

<p>“Stand by to lower the lifeboat,” shouted Mr. Harris.</p>

<p>The boat was made free and brought even with the rail. Every member of
the <i>Wilmington’s</i> own crew now on the ship piled into it. One sailor
from the <i>Iroquois</i> leaped after them.</p>

<p>“Lower away,” called the executive officer at a favorable moment, “but
be sure not to cut the painter.”</p>

<p>Yet no sooner was the little craft afloat than one of the freighter’s
panic-stricken men whipped out his knife and severed the line that held
her to the steamer. Like a shot she was flung far from the side of the
<i>Wilmington</i>. The men on the <i>Iroquois</i>, waiting to slide down into the
lifeboat, were left stranded on the deck of the sinking vessel.</p>

<p>“Pull her back,” roared the executive officer.</p>

<p>The men in the lifeboat bent to their oars, but they were only merchant
sailors, and knew little about handling oars. They were utterly unable
to sweep the lifeboat up against the wind. Though they pulled hard, the
craft was driven steadily farther and farther away in the darkness. In a
moment it was lost to sight.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried Mr. Harris. “Over with your life rafts.” The sailors
leaped to the rafts and slid them over the rail into the sea.</p>

<p>“After them,” shouted the executive officer. “It’s your last chance.
She’ll sink in a minute. Catch your rafts and swim away, or the suction
will take you down.”</p>

<p>Into the sea went the sailors, leaping from the <i>Wilmington’s</i> rail far,
far out into the heaving waters. In a moment only Henry and his
commander were left.</p>

<p>“Over with you, Harper,” ordered the executive officer. “Try to get to
one of the rafts.”</p>

<p>Henry looked out over the side of the ship. All was inky darkness. The
<i>Iroquois</i> could be seen coming on apace, but she was still one thousand
yards away. The winds were lashing the sea with fury. The tumult of the
waters was terrifying to hear. Henry was frightened as he had never been
before, but he did not lose his head. “I will go when you go,” he said.</p>

<p>In his hand Mr. Harris held a long-barreled flash-light for signaling,
with a patent contact strip about the handle. Now through the blackness
of the night he was sending flashes of light, to direct the oncoming
cutter. Astonished, Henry saw that his commander was sending a message
just as he himself had learned to do through the cutter’s blinkers, with
dots and dashes of light. He stood motionless and read the message,
“Please hurry. My men are in the water.”</p>

<p>A feeling of inexpressible admiration came over Henry. Here was a man
voluntarily risking his life to save his men. As calmly as though he
were safe ashore, instead of standing on the threshold of death, the
executive officer continued to flash his directing signals. Then another
thought came to Henry. “He’s a Coast Guard officer. So am I. I’ll try to
act like one.” He became calm. And as he watched his big superior, so
quiet and unafraid, fearful only lest the <i>Iroquois</i> should be too late
to save his men, something of the same feeling of strength and courage
came to Henry.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay by him to the end,” he muttered.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait for the end. The <i>Wilmington</i> suddenly began to
settle rapidly by the head. Her bulkhead had given way and the sea was
rushing in. As the freighter settled, she likewise turned. The executive
officer crawled aft, out over the taffrail, and continued his signaling.
A sweep of his torch, as he crawled to the rail, revealed his feet. He
was still clad in his heavy boots.</p>

<p>“You haven’t taken your boots off, Mr. Harris,” said Henry, quietly; and
whipping out his knife, he knelt once more at the feet of this man who
was above fear, cut the laces, and dragged off the heavy boots. Before
he had time to remove his own shoes there was a terrific crash as the
boiler exploded, and the stern of the <i>Wilmington</i> suddenly rose high in
air.</p>

<p>“Jump!” shouted the commander; “and swim as far away as you can.”</p>

<p>He clutched Henry’s hand. Together they leaped far out from the ship. In
another second they were deep under the chilling water, and Henry was
fighting to reach the surface.</p>

<p>He came up gasping for breath. The ship was just plunging beneath the
waves. Above the roar of the winds Henry could distinguish the sucking
noise as she disappeared. He felt himself pulled toward the spot where
the ship had been. With all his might he strove against the suction.
Presently he felt that he had struggled free from it. He swam about,
calling for Mr. Harris. After a few minutes he heard an answering call
in the darkness. It was his commander. Rejoiced, he swam toward the
sound. Presently he bumped into something. It proved to be one of the
life rafts. He got up on it and called to Mr. Harris. The latter swam to
the raft and got on. No one else was to be seen. From time to time they
heard shouts.</p>

<p>The <i>Iroquois</i> was now near at hand. On she came at full speed. With her
searchlight she was sweeping the waves. When she came to the first of
the men in the water, she hove to. One after another her boats were
lowered until all were afloat. In the bow of each rode a sailor, armed
with a powerful light. Over the waves coursed the little boats, calling,
searching, rescuing, for man after man was plucked from the foaming
waters and lifted to safety. Finally one of the boats came toward the
executive officer and Henry. The two shouted in unison. Their cries were
heard, and the boat came rapidly toward them, but long before it reached
them a sudden wave came crashing over the raft and Henry lost his grip
and was swept off into the tumultuous sea.</p>

<p>He struggled to fight his way back, but he was almost paralyzed with
cold and worn out and exhausted. He feared he could never make it.
Suddenly he found himself in a grip of iron. The executive officer had
swum after him. They regained the raft. Desperately now Henry clung to
the planks, while his superior officer held fast to him with his legs,
all the while clinging to the planks with his hands. The small boat came
up and the two were lifted aboard.</p>

<p>What happened after that Henry hardly knew, but presently he found
himself in the engine-room of the cutter. He was being stripped and
rubbed. Some one was giving him hot coffee to drink.</p>

<p>When he was able to get about the ship, he inquired for the others who
had been in the sea. The lifeboat, so clumsily manned, had capsized, and
one of the English sailors had been drowned. Every other man who had
gone to the <i>Wilmington</i> had been rescued. He learned that the <i>Oneida</i>
had found the <i>Hiawatha</i> and that both boats were safely on their way to
Boston.</p>

<p>Two days later the <i>Iroquois</i> lay peacefully at her anchor off St.
George. Rollin came to the wireless shack looking for Henry, who had
entirely recovered from his hard experience.</p>

<p>“The captain wants to see you, Mr. Harper,” he said.</p>

<p>Henry rose and made his way to the cabin, wondering what the commander
wanted now.</p>

<p>“I suppose you will be going to see your friends at your first
opportunity, Henry,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Indeed I shall, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have a lot to tell them,” smiled the commander.</p>

<p>“Won’t they be surprised when they hear all I’ve got to say!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Harris has been telling me about the last moments of the
<i>Wilmington</i>,” continued Captain Hardwick. “Of course your probationary
period was up long ago, as you know, Henry, but you haven’t had a chance
to see your friends since then. It occurred to me that when you tell
them you have passed your probationary period satisfactorily, you might
like to add that Captain Hardwick says you have qualified for the Coast
Guard in every way. Do you understand, sir? In <i>every</i> way.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Henry. “Thank you very much;” and with heart
beating high he marched from the cabin and made ready to go over to
Manhattan to tell Willie and Roy the news of his permanent appointment
as third-class radio man on the good ship <i>Iroquois</i>.</p>
